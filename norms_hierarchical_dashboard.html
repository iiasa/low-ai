I was just making a scenario were pain is not a factor, maybe you still thought them being domesticated, or the enviroment are reasons powerful enough by themselves to agree with veganism.\n\nOf course speciesism is a thing. Its one of the main reasons why we think killing dogs and monkeys is brutal and we invent more and more painful ways to end cockroaches lifes. But should all life be valued, or is there a point in evolution where there is a red line where ethics of killing you begin. For example many animals are loners and have few pain receptors, making them hardly eligible to your example of animal. However you also say their well being should be taken into account which means self preservation, pain and companionship are not the qualities that are requiered for them to be treated painlessly by you. Am I getting this wrong?\n\nFor example animals like the starfish have no brain, so without a neural system their aim of self preservation is probably similar to that of a plant however some people treat them as pets.\n\nAnyways Im rambling all I am getting at is that animal and ethics are a very muddy floor.

Hemp milk is very simple to make. Just buy the deshelled hemp seeds from Trader Joe's, blend with water (find a recipe for proportions), strain with nut bag, put in jar and refrigerate.

After that, if you want to look for entire recipes, try \"vegan ___ recipe\".  \n\nHere are some things you might want to try if you're interested in replicating meat, dairy or eggs: \n\n* Plant milks for cow's milk are some of easiest substitutes.  There are many different flavors (cashew, coconut, almond, oat, rice, soy, pea, hemp, etc), offering *more* variety not less, often available for just as cheap, and they tend to work the same as dairy milk in both cooking and baking as direct 1-1 substitutes.  Find one you like the taste of, and try using it!  About the only thing you have to look out for is using unsweetened versions in savory dishes, and saving sweetened ones for sweet ones or desserts.   \n* For many ingredients, you can use just a single thing as a substitute (like plant milk anywhere for dairy milk), but eggs are an exception.  The substitutes you use for eggs in [baking](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+egg+substitute+baking&amp;num=100&amp;rlz=1C1TSNF_enUS786US786&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin673Orq_dAhVEi5AKHfTIB1gQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1294&amp;bih=671) is very different from [cooking](https://freefromharm.org/food-products/delicious-vegan-eggs-recipes/).   \n* [mashed chickpeas](http://sweetpotatosoul.com/2015/06/vegan-chickpea-tuna-salad-video.html) for tuna salad, because they become flaky when mashed\n* [Korean](https://www.killingthyme.net/2017/08/30/korean-bbq-jackfruit-sliders/) or [BBQ jackfruit](https://minimalistbaker.com/bbq-jackfruit-sandwiches-with-avocado-slaw/) for the texture of pulled pork\n*  [Seitan](http://www.isachandra.com/2012/01/vegan_sausage/), also known as vital wheat gluten, for sausages (or many other meat imitations) \n* [rice paper](https://yupitsvegan.com/vegan-rice-paper-bacon/) for bacon \n* Vegan cheeses don't always have great substitutes, but commercial vegan mayo and vegan ice cream (and homemade recipes for these things) are very good.  \n\nHonestly, some of the things vegan cooks have come up with are just mind-blowingly creative.  \n\n-------\n\n&gt; what would you like for them to do to make sure its a nice eating space for everyone.\n\nI think one of the big things for some people is not cooking with their cookware.  Of course some vegans are different and won't care, but some vegans really don't like the taste or smell of animal products, especially meat.  This is particularly important for the seasoning on cast iron, because the flavors and smells that get into it become a long lasting part of it.  \n\nAnother thing might be organizing any shared refrigerator or shelf so that he has his own separate space he can grab stuff from and knows won't contain non-vegan ingredients.

Learn about which food dyes are derived from animals — some red dyes are made from ground-up insects, some blue &amp; purple dyes from ground-up sea shells. Learn about other terminology, too — stuff like casein is still in \"vegetarian\" cheese alternatives, and may show up on labels in lieu of traditional terms like milk, milkfat, etc.\n\nAlso be wary of stuff touting \"natural flavoring\" — I was still consuming V8 for *years* after going veg/vegan because the label didn't explicitly state that said flavoring involved animal by-products.

They also experience pain. This means that bees are thinking individuals whose needs and wishes are usurped for our benefit when we consume honey. This also means that bees suffer when their honey is taken from them.\nIn commercial honey operations, queens are purchased after having been artificially inseminated with crushed males. The wings of these queens are ripped off to prevent them from flying away, and while they would normally live to four years old, they are killed at age two to make room for younger queens. Further, commercial hives are often left to die by starvation and exposure or killed as a means of controlling stock. Even in smaller honey operations where bees are treated gently, some are crushed to death when their hives are disturbed. Beekeepers in these environments often replace honey with sugar or corn syrup to maximize profits, but these are not a bee’s natural food, and they are not sufficient to sustain an entire hive through the winter. Ultimately, wild hives create living conditions and food stores ideally suited to sustain themselves, but human intervention results in starvation, suffering and death for bees. So since humans do not need honey to survive, eating it is indeed unethical.)\n\n[Bot version 1.2.1.8]", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "0", "1.2.2_injunctive": "4", "1.3.1_reference_group": "none", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "none", "1.3.2_mechanism": "blame/shame", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 110, "comment": "Getting people to not be straight up carnists is of course our first goal here.

Common staples like bread, rice, pasta, beans, oats, vegetables are all going to be affordable. I have known people personally who have been made homeless who subsequently had to live in accommodation, who continued to be vegan. Indeed, many animal products are expensive.

In reality, it is bacteria found in animals, excrement, unwashed vegetables and dirty water that produces it. B12 is not exclusive to animal products.\n\nHaving said this, in today’s world vegans must supplement B12 with an oral supplement or by eating fortified foods, but this doesn’t invalidate veganism. Stating that because we can’t get B12 naturally from plants implies a vegan diet is bad is a version of the logical fallacy called “appeal to nature“. Not only is it a fallacious argument, but most people that live in modern society supplement their diets in one way or another.\n\n&gt;If you are not capable of spending more money to compensate for reduced protein intake or get niche vegan foods that have those nutrients, then this introduces an economic factor that, again, undermines the foundation of veganism via practicability.\n\nVeganism can be expensive, but it is by no means a necessity. As with any eating pattern, a vegan diet can be as expensive or as cheap as we want it to be. Generally, however, a plant-based diet is substantially cheaper than most diets out there, given that the staple foods in a vegan diet (and coincidentally also staples in impoverished societies) are things like rice, beans, lentils, potatoes, bread, tofu and so forth.

They would let the cats outside to roam until we moved to a place with a large balcony and we started only letting them out onto the balcony for fresh air and sunbathing. No roaming the neighborhood.\nOne day I look out the glass door to the balcony and see the little female cat has a dove in her mouth, and there's blood everywhere. \n\nI didn't know what to do. I was probably 22 or so. So I tried to release the dove from her jaw, which eventually worked. I figured I had to get her inside away from the dove so I picked her up. She starts wrestling and scratching me with her bloody claws but I get her inside to the tub nearby, and try rinsing the blood off both of us thinking that would reduce the chance of, at least me, getting a blood infection or something to that effect.\n\nWhen I return to the door, I see the dove still there, laying down, alive, breathing rapidly, bleeding. So I call multiple animal-related organizations to ask what to do. None of them take injured wild animals. After probably 10 minutes of calls, I reach one vet office who could take the dove and they're a 30-40 minute drive from me. The office gives me instructions for how to transport the injured dove: use an old tshirt to capture, gently wrap &amp; calm them, put them in a brown bag or box. \n\nSo I hang up and go out there with a Tshirt and suddenly this dove gets up and flutters to the railing. I'm surprised they were able to do that with their injuries, but I approach slowly anyway, t-shirt in hand. The dove drops off the railing and shakily coasts down to the grass from this 3rd floor balcony. Once down there I'm thinking \"maybe they're okay?\" And I watch for a minute. This dove's partner shows up and starts attacking the injured one. I couldn't tell if it was a \"get up, c'mon let's get outta here\" type of attack, or attempted murder, but it seemed pretty aggressive. The injured dove wasn't getting up.\n\nI raced downstairs and somehow, after multiple attempts, got this dove into a tshirt and bag and got in my car. Drove the 30-40 minutes to the vet, gave them the dove in the bag, made a donation and left. I didn't call them later because I didn't even want the emotional burden of knowing whether the dove had died... \n\nMy takeaway now is HOLY SHIT THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE because I did all that, and then probably ate a different animal that same evening, maybe even while petting a cat. \n\nThe End.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 130, "comment": "My response to “why vegan” is to just say “it aligns with my morals.” And leave it with that.

We can only strive for perfection and forgive our own mistakes, being fully aware that it was a mistake but we're doing our best.

As far as we know, your health won't deteriorate significantly when you eat a little meat every three months or so. But every piece of meat eaten will undeniably cause a sentient creature to be abused and killed, that's where the ethical argument for plant-based eating comes into the equation. (Also: Health has only minimally to do with the consumption of non-dietary animal products like wool and bees wax for example.)\n\nI'm in favour of talking about health related to a whole-food plant-based diet, but I don't support it exclusively promoting health when talking about not consuming animals.

Ultimately, promoting a healthy diet is necessary if we want to be humanitarian but I definitely do not think that vegans who don't really give a shit about healthy eating are somehow \"lesser\" than WFPB vegans.

This is taken in its entirety from the /r/vegan sidebar information. Here are links to what some of them have to say on the subject:\n\n**[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/)**\n\n* *It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.*\n\n**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**\n\n* *A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.*\n\n**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**\n\n* *With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.*\n\n**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**\n\n* *A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.*\n\n**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**\n\n* *Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.*\n\n**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**\n\n* *Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.*\n\n**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**\n\n* *Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.*\n\n**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**\n\n* *A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.*\n\n**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**\n\n* *Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.*\n\n**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**\n\n* *Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.*\n\n\n\n\n", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "0", "1.2.2_injunctive": "3", "1.3.1_reference_group": "online community", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "pushing for", "1.3.2_mechanism": "community standard", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 191, "comment": "\nThanks for posting to r/Vegan! &amp;#128037;\n\n**Please note:** Civil discussion is welcome, trolls and personal abuse [are not](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/rules).

I’ve only met one who’s fine with gelatin, and she was vegetarian for health, no part due to ethics. And she still didn’t eat lard.\n\nMost that don’t pay attention to rennet simply don’t know (at least, that’s what it was for me- I didn’t know cheese contained stomach enzymes until I was already working on becoming vegan, so that fact really just made coming off of cheese easier) or feel that it’s “unavoidable” because they “have” to eat cheese to be healthy (concerns about protein, b12, calcium, omega 3s, etc) and feel that they are already doing what they feasibly can by avoiding meat and the other 2 major and most prevalent by products. It IS flawed, but that is the line of thinking I have seen from those who know and continue to consume it, and I think is mainly due to deeply ingrained beliefs about the food pyramid & internalized propaganda from the dairy industry (the “got milk?” campaign was EXTREMELY successful, for example), as well as straight up dairy addiction and, yes, partially laziness. On the other hand though, lard and gelatin can in absolutely no world be considered a necessary part of a healthy diet- lard is generally seen as one of the least healthy fats unless you’re really into the carnivore manosphere, and gelatin is typically just part of certain sweet treats.

The global shift towards plant-based diets can actually mitigate the demand for land, considering that animal agriculture requires more land than plant agriculture for the same calorie yield.\n\nRegarding water use and the impact of pesticides and herbicides, while these are valid concerns for all agricultural sectors, animal agriculture intensifies these issues. For instance, it's widely documented that producing animal-based foods typically requires more water than plant-based foods. When considering the water footprint per calorie or gram of protein, plant foods often show a more efficient use of resources. Techniques such as drip irrigation, used in avocado production in Spain and Israel, highlight advancements in agricultural practices that can mitigate water usage effectively.\n\nTransportation impact, often highlighted through the example of importing fruits like avocados, does add to the carbon footprint of food. However, the transport phase accounts for a relatively small portion of a food's overall environmental impact. It's the production phase that dominates the carbon footprint, where plant-based foods generally have a lower impact than animal-based foods. Avocados, despite their water usage, generate significantly less greenhouse gas emissions compared to animal products like beef, pork, and chicken when compared on a per kilogram basis of edible food.\n\nMoreover, focusing solely on avocados or almonds as examples of high-impact vegan foods overlooks the vast array of plant-based foods with lower environmental footprints. Eating a diverse vegan diet can minimize reliance on any single crop, thereby distributing its environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the impact of vegan diets on the environment is not negligible, it's considerably lower than the impact of diets that include animal products. Suggesting that reducing meat consumption without eliminating it could achieve most climate goals underestimates the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and pollution that a fully plant-based diet can offer. Given the disproportionate impact of animal agriculture on these environmental metrics, a shift toward veganism presents a more effective strategy for addressing climate change and environmental degradation.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "3", "1.3.1_reference_group": "none", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "none", "1.3.2_mechanism": "other", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 248, "comment": "http://www.nomeatathlete.com/gain-weight-vegan/\n\nIf you incorporate more calorie dense foods like avocado, nuts/seeds, coconut, olives you should be okay.\n\nBack when I made more hearty smoothies, I was adding in avocado, oatmeal, and seeds (or beans) to my fruit and liquid base.

We are so fortunate to live in times where information and knowledge resources are at the click of a keyboard, instant information download from brain to brain is possible and happening.  It's amazing, really.  Man, in the 80's no one had ever heard of this, vegetarians were fringe and vegans were fringe of the fringe.  I was fortunate to be semi-adopted into a family of Hindu's who taught me vegetarian cooking, in the South, deep fried chicken steak BBQ chicken giblets country, I was very, very, lucky.  They were like an oasis of fresh, green, spicy deliciousness in a sea of oily Alabama smokehouses and diners where the tables have a permanent film of grease on the forks and the walls.\n\n I'd like to be a resource for people who have questions, just as I once turned to my Hindu friends for help and support.  I'm sure my questions to them seemed elementary.  They were always patient and supportive no matter what, they seemed thrilled that someone was so interested in their food and culture, and I was thrilled to find out this entire thousands of years old cuisine without meat existed.  Going vegan from that basis was very easy, they invested over a decade in teaching and training us, cooking lessons, spices, food combinations, etc.\n\nSo going vegan from vegetarian for 20+ years wasn't too hard, but there were certain things that made it a LOT easier.

How could you possibly replace that as a vegan? I don't mind posting the exact same thing over and over again. Which is this recipe for pasta alfredo sauce.  Honestly, I'd had some doubts about veganism when I first started, I thought, maybe once in a while I'll have to take a break to dabble in cheese, even though I hated the idea of these baby cows being slaughtered and these mama cows being hormonally injected, milked by machines.  These aren't kind people worshipping cows, grateful for the milk of a beloved family pet cow.

It made me rethink everything,  what I thought was \"possible\", why did I think it wouldn't have been, why did I assume veganism would be self-imposed restriction and loss, where did these prejudices come from?  How many other things did I take for granted that kept me handing over money week after week to Big Dairy, when I didn't need to, when there was a plant based option all along with no cholesterol, no suffering, no hormones, no antibiotics and misery, I only believed I needed dairy to trigger the same palate recognition, when I didn't at all?

Even within the vegan community it’s a controversial topic.  According to one poll of pet owners, approximately 1.6 percent of dogs and 0.7 percent of cats were being fed exclusively plant-based diets.  However, the same poll found that:\n\n>In total, 35% (1,083/3,130) of pet owners who did not already feed a plant-based diet to their pet indicated interest in doing so....[\\[1\\]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210806)\n\nA number of veterinary associations, such as the British Veterinary Association (BVA) – “the largest membership community for the veterinary profession in the UK”[\\[2\\]](https://www.bva.co.uk/about-us/) – have taken positions against providing dogs and cats with plant-based diets.[\\[3\\]](https://www.bva.co.uk/news-and-blog/blog-article/is-it-safe-to-feed-my-dog-a-plant-based-diet-hold-the-greens-only-meals-why-the-jury-is-still-out-on-vegan-dog-diets/)  However, these positions have been criticized for being in opposition to available evidence.\\[4\\]  Concerning dogs, one scientific researcher on the topic stated that:\n\n>There are now eight studies about the health of dogs on vegan diets....  \\[O\\]ut all eight of these studies, seven of them support the use of vegan diets in dogs and the oldest\\[,\\] smallest study does not. On balance, the weight of evidence is very clearly in favor of the use of nutritionally sound vegan diets for dogs.[\\[5\\]](https://www.ourhenhouse.org/ep656/)\n\nIndeed, there do appear to be at least seven studies whose results support nutritionally-adequate plant-based diets for dogs[\\[6\\]](https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114509389254)\\[7\\][\\[8\\]](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani6090057)\\[9\\][\\[10\\]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253292)[\\[11\\]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265662)[\\[12\\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.06.002) and one study, the oldest and smallest, opposed.[\\[13\\]](https://doi.org/10.3177/jnsv.33.129)  Between the studies whose results supported plant-based diets for dogs, they found that pet owners who fed their dogs plant-based diets reported fewer health issues,[\\[11\\]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265662)[\\[12\\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.06.002) while other studies support these claims by showing that dogs fed nutritionally-adequate plant-based diets returned healthy clinical measurements.[\\[6\\]](https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114509389254)\\[7\\]\\[9\\]  (One of the studies bizarrely stated that veterinarians cannot recommend plant-based diets for dogs in the very same sentence in which they stated that their results did not support “the insular disapprobation of a vegan diet for ... dogs.”  This is in the same summary where they concluded that they found no abnormalities among the dogs being fed plant-based diets.  It appears that this particular claim was contradicted by their own results.)\\[7\\]\n\nAn additional potential benefit of feeding a dog a plant-based diet is that three of the four most common food allergens for dogs are animal products: beef, dairy, and chicken.[\\[14\\]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0633-8)\n\nThat being said, as with any commercial pet food intended to be the sole-provider for a companion animal’s nutritional requirements, care must be taken to ensure that any particular brand is actually capable of providing for their needs.  There have been studies that found that particular commercial brands of plant-based pet foods did not meet nutritional requirements or match what was stated on their packaging.[\\[18\\]](https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.2004.225.1670)[\\[19\\]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227046)  This reflects a larger issue not unique to plant-based pet foods.  As one author wrote in an American publication:\n\n>No agency requires proof of pet food health claims, and no pet food company is willing to invest in decades of research to determine whether its products keep animals healthier and extend their lives....  Pet food companies say they do research, but it is rarely done in a scientific fashion, with comparable control and experimental groups.[\\[20\\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/01brod.html)\n\nWhile sentiments that dogs and especially cats cannot be healthy on plant-based diets are quite common, even among veterinarians, they simply aren’t supported by the available scientific literature.  Similarly, the greater claim that feeding dogs and/or cats a plant-based diet is inherently cruel is unsubstantiated.  In fact, this was the exact conclusion of a 2023 systemic review of 16 studies on plant-based diets for dogs and cats:\n\n>This review has found that there is no convincing evidence of major impacts of vegan diets on dog or cat health....  There was also evidence of benefits for animals arising as a result of feeding them vegan diets.[\\[21\\]](https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci10010052)\n\nWhile it is understandable to have strong convictions about the treatment of the non-human animals we care about, those convictions should be grounded in scientific research.  The studies to-date suggests that both dogs and cats can thrive on plant-based diets.  It appears to be a growing field of research, so perhaps we will see more studies become available in the near-future.\n\nAs a final word, if you are considering transitioning a companion animal to a plant-based diet, be sure to thoroughly research their intended food-source to ensure that it will adequately provide for their needs.  You may also want to make the change gradually, as sudden changes to their diet can cause digestive issues.[\\[22\\]](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/right-way-switch-dog-foods/)\n\n[**References**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/115ilfw/comment/j9692os/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "3", "1.3.1_reference_group": "online community", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "against", "1.3.2_mechanism": "community standard", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 365, "comment": "Several family members are now where I was a few years ago.

I agree it's an absurd possibility, which is why I don't think it matters to the definition of veganism. We don't need to define words to categorize hypothetical and obscure value sets (e.g. vegan cannibalism).\n\nI disagree completely.  Hypotheticals are invaluable tools to test the soundness of an idea.  Without the ethical foundation veganism is nothing more than an arbitrary diet/fashion, and that foundation is quicksand if you exclude humans.\n\n>Nor do definitions necessarily need to exclude irrational interpretations. For example, the majority of environmentalists are nonvegan and I personally think that is absurd. Yet those environmentalists exist, and they represent a value set that is neither hypothetical nor obscure.\n\nI would agree that it is absurd, and would say it is a good argument that they are *not* environmentalists.  But \"environmentalist\" does not have the same weight as an ethical position like veganism.  It is also very possible for a non-vegan environmentalist to have a smaller footprint than a vegan.  \"Not vegan\" could mean they only eat eggs from the pet chickens they live with in their zero-waste off-grid tiny house.  \"Vegan\" would include a wealthy businessman who flies in a private jet five days a week.\n\n>The impetus and rationale for the new term was not arbitrary word-play, it was an attempt to label a set of beliefs that didn't previously have a name.\n\nSure, I don't disagree with the historical origins of the word, but we're not beholden to \"the\" original definition, especially when it comes to philosophical positions..

Preferably as many as possible to maximize profit. \n\nRed Jungle Fowl who modern domesticated chickens descended from only laid approximately [10-15 eggs per year](http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/about_chickens.pdf). That’s not enough for humans though, so we selectively breed egg-laying hens to lay much more than this. A modern laying hen now lays [200-320 eggs per year]( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/science/how-many-eggs-does-a-chicken-lay-in-its-lifetime.html). \n\nThis has a very negative effect on chickens’ welfare; after all we are manipulating their genetics for our own personal gain and profit, not for their interests. \n\nIt starts with osteoporosis, a disease characterized by altered bone volume and mineralization. Bone is the metabolic reservoir for calcium used in egg shell production, and moving calcium from bone to egg shell leaves the hen prone to osteoporosis, subsequent bone fragility, and bone fractures.\n\nIn 2004, it was estimated that [80-89% of commercial egg-laying hens suffer from osteoporosis](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/HSUS--Welfare%20Issues%20with%20Selective%20Breeding%20of%20Egg-Laying%20Hens%20for%20Productivity.pdf).  \n\nOf course, big eggs are more profitable too. Selectively breeding hens to lay large eggs leads to cloacal prolapse, a condition in which the outer end of the reproductive tract fails to retract following egg-laying. In case that doesn’t sound painful enough, you can see how painful it looks (NSFW) [here](https://imgur.com/M3ROqRy) \n\nAs if it’s not bad enough to have your insides hanging out, other hens are known to peck at the exposed oviduct leading to [hemorrhages, infection and cannibalism](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/HSUS--Welfare%20Issues%20with%20Selective%20Breeding%20of%20Egg-Laying%20Hens%20for%20Productivity.pdf). \n\nFinally, if you’re a hen who isn’t suffering horribly from osteoporosis or cloacal prolapse, there’s a good chance you’ll get cancer. Laying hens selectively bred for high egg production can also suffer from tumors of the oviduct. [Adenomas (benign glandular tumors) and adenocarcinomas (malignant glandular tumors) are commonly found in commercial laying hens, possibly due to prolonged exposure of the oviduct to steroid sex hormones controlling egg production](http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/125/2/42). \n\nFrom [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474556/) study with 466 hens, 32% had cancer. They were between 2 and 7 years old.\n\nIn [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759668). study out of 155 hens, 30 had cancer. So about 19.35%. That's hens all under 5 years old.\n\nSo far, we’ve selectively bred chickens to make their body’s serve us at the expense of their welfare and health. Their bones will break, their insides will spill out and cancer will spread through them so we can eat and profit from their eggs.  \n\n# Step 2: Kill the males\n\nFact: Male chickens do no lay eggs. This means that for every 1 female egg-laying hen there is a male chick that has no profitable use for the industry. Male chicks of this breed do not grow fast enough to profitably sold for meat. \n\nThe industry then disposes of these male chicks as waste products. They are literally [gassed to death](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/hatched-discarded-gassed-what-happens-to-male-chicks-in-the-uk-10088509.html), [suffocated in garbage bags](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/unilever-working-to-end-the-culling-of-male-chicks-114100400651_1.html) or tossed alive into a [macerator](http://www.cbc.ca/news/male-chicks-ground-up-alive-at-egg-hatcheries-1.823644) which grinds them up.\n\nIt is a literal (NSFW) [conveyor belt of death](https://imgur.com/qM7YyN4). \nAnd this conveyor belt of death is for the most innocent creatures (1 day old baby male chicks) going into the equivalent of our kitchen sink garbage disposal. It is happening all the time- constantly to the tune of [6 billion chicks per year globally](https://www.wattagnet.com/ext/resources/uploadedFiles/WattAgNet/Footer/Footer_Content/2011_Poultry_Trends.pdf). \n\n# Step 3: Mutilation\n\nChickens naturally engage in mild pecking to establish the [social hierarchy or pecking order](http://articles.extension.org/pages/66088/feather-pecking-and-cannibalism-in-small-and-backyard-poultry-flocks). \n\nPecking can however become overly aggressive and lead to cannibalism when chickens are malnourished, stressed, injured or confined. Rather than address these issues, the industry prefers to mutilate birds by debeaking them without anaesthetic, shown [here](https://imgur.com/cduRIWA). Essentially a hot blade is used to partially remove the beak to avoid the issues of pecking described above. It is sometimes referred to as beak trimming.\n\nWhile often thought that the tip of the beak cannot feel pain, there is evidence the tip of the beak is [incredibly sensitive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1166494/?page=1). Aside from being excruciatingly painful, beak trimming can lead to an inability for chickens to [feed properly](https://watermark.silverchair.com/japoulres13-0468.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAa8wggGrBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGcMIIBmAIBADCCAZEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMuAc-EUUWODJYxnSvAgEQgIIBYjb08pnB3VRx8E9Bf_DsXpShRY_hi3WBRDi2EhZnkI0WV6V0Avl1a_ax5Ke9ljXYc10HxlqJmcWYXVa41lfXkVBSfA11szKwE9H-xt_ka7PUNSMkalOgcV2w5YdMbu4slWm_1oPbCJuwhLpsJ5eAm7cjvK_zQJ2686ebwQxM13jKuH4vNVxEA0JLDJddw2suJFfff8_NoPoBnC1WyOEFYI2u5NRAaKALldDkIg1vK1-PIqGYTrdrAL0CWGQK7D_kzAirfk_WmnZila4HB0qCp028XrKehdz1cMDE-KR5IfxYxhy_EDCjY1fK72OfPJ6JyiaGuiQM2BJDceT33UT7Mkza0fDol9ko5qC63IpNViIcJMdcw51gXArgnppzvQs5dCNvfceEaMU6WY2p-Hgs7AnnGYSpjCbZlFPDPFWeves7LYt6CWy6ow-gvGG2yKxBJVHJCxtyyAbSW5fJ9NDl66YHuA), leading to malnutrition. \n\nIt is worth noting that debeaking is illegal in parts of Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Instead birds just peck themselves to death in confinement due to overcrowding and stress. \n\n# Step 4: Confinement\n\nIn North America the majority of hens spend their lives in battery cages looking a little something like [this](https://www.blogher.com/files/Conventional_chicken_hero_0.jpg). They are denied most of their natural instincts, unable to spread their wings, frustration from being unable to nest, not to mention feces everywhere, dropped on from cages above you and your cage-mates. \n\nHow small are these cages? [300-350cm2 in the United States and 450cm2 in Canada](http://m.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/HSUS-Synopsis-of-Expert-Opinions-on-Battery-Cages-and-Hen-Welfare.pdf). To put that in perspective, 300 to 350 square centimeters approximates 46.5 to 54 square inches, and 450 square centimeters converts to 70 square inches, less than a single 8.5”x11” piece of paper (93.5 square inches). \n\nMaybe you’re a chicken from the UK where battery cages were banned in 2012. You get an enriched cage! [This]( https://imgur.com/dvDFlX0) is what that looks like. Turns out being a slave for humans in the UK isn’t that much better than being a slave elsewhere.  \n\nSurely free-range will save the day right? Free-range is really just a marketing tactic used by companies to make consumers feel less guilty about buying eggs. Instead of cages, up to 16,000 chickens are crammed into a shed or barn. \n\nIt looks like [this](https://imgur.com/l3USe6q). \n\nFree range is not legally defined in most places.  It generally means *access* to the outdoors which almost can never occur due to overcrowding. \n\nFurthermore, chickens free from cages suffer approximately [double the mortality rate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/is-the-free-range-egg-trend-really-just-a-shell-game/article29797385/) compared to caged birds due to a number of factors including cannibalism that spreads more freely when not contained to cages (birds tend to mimic each other’s behaviour). \n\n# Step 5: Death (and possibly starvation first)\n\nChickens may live naturally over 10 years but in the industry, [egg-laying chickens are killed usually when they are under 2 years old]( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/egg-laying-hens_us_59c3c93fe4b0c90504fc04a1). This is because as they age, they lay less eggs and it is no longer profitable to keep them alive. \n\nTheir flesh is not the desirable tenderness for consumers so they are often used in low-grade foods or pet food. Other times they are simply disposed of as waste. They are likely to be gassed to death or have their throats slit. \n\nBut wait, there’s more! \n\nIn some countries (most notably the United States), hens are starved at the end of their first laying cycle to shock their bodies into laying more eggs. This is done by manipulating a natural process called “molting” where the chicken sheds their feathers to grow new ones while rejuvenating their reproductive system. \n\n“Forced molting” is achieved through withholding food for no less than 5 days and as long as 14 days according to California poultry researcher Donald Bell. In 2003, approximately [75% of flocks were forced molted in the US](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/article/history-changing-scenarios-and-future-strategies-to-induce-moulting-in-laying-hens/7DEB7759F478C87506977EC9A2A7BB04). \n\nForced molting is illegal in the UK and not widely practiced in Canada. Instead, these countries just kill the birds immediately after their first laying cycle so they can be sold as low-grade meat or pet food. \n", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "0", "1.2.2_injunctive": "4", "1.3.1_reference_group": "none", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "none", "1.3.2_mechanism": "blame/shame", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 434, "comment": "Vegan at Olive garden?

Yet a mention of Buddhists doesn’t cause eye rolling and negative perception. \n\nYes it’s difficult to know how “far along” a small movement such as veganism “should be”.  Ironically, most people disagree with the practice of factory farming, yet they continue to support it for a variety of reasons (eg health concerns, convenience, ignorance of other options, taste, cost). \n\nVeganism faces a unique hurdle because its eventual success requires behavior change from everyone. In other movements, such as civil rights or woman’s suffrage, you could personally be against the cause, yet policy and legislation supersede your personal preference, and the movement succeeds even if many people aren’t on board. \n\nThe problem isn’t with much of vegan advocacy is that it’s based in aggressive confrontation style activism. Research shows that this isn’t helping the cause. So many activists exhibit black-and-white thinking and engage in practices that aren’t inclusive.  As long as people can dismiss the messenger, they can dismiss the message. E.g. “That person just spilled a bunch of milk cartons all over the store. What a psycho.”\n\nAdvocacy needs to be framed in the positive. It should provide opportunities for encouragement and education.

And what rings intuitively true for me is how in the story of the Christ, only a few fish were diverted for the people in a time of an emergency only, the rest were miracle fish and perhaps not really fish at all, but rather fish-like manna. And while, I personally do not discriminate against fish by eating them, and feel they have exactly the same capacity for emotions, thoughts and survival as any other land-living creature, I can see how people could have had a tough time recognizing their divinity due to their nature as very alien and very predacious creatures. While the thought of eating fish disgusts me, it's easier for me personally to identify with mammals and avians and can understand myself being less emotional over the loss of the life of a fish than a land animal for this basic, yet fallacious reason, and while the sacrifice of the fishes may be symbolic of bounty which replaces mammalian slaughter, it does appear to be a one-off occurrence, and as such the ichthys represents that one isolated miracle and sacrifice, rather than the concept that Jesus was a full-time pescatarian, a fisherman or someone who encouraged others to kill aquatic animals regularly for food. Also, when it comes to hunting and fishing by ancient peoples, I really don't have any problem with it, while these people are living in small numbers and in harmony with the biosphere, my major impetus for Veganism derives from the unnatural exploitation of domesticated animals, factory farms, industrial fisheries and hatcheries as I've always been an environmental vegan first and foremost and an ethical vegan second.

Maybe I should have been a bit more conciliatory about that, but on the other hand I felt like the complaints in these comments weren't taken seriously enough and I'm a bit peeved about it.\n\n&gt; That response indicated they had considered some of the issues with the post.\n\nI don't doubt that.\n\n&gt;  I would still hesitate to call the OP offensive based on being glib/insensitive.\n\nAs a rule, I judge actions and not people. I think OP is probably a perfectly lovely person that didn't think through their post, and the transgression is one that I would call somewhat mild. But there is a problem here, and I think we've more-or-less converged on what it is.\n\n&gt; If there's no way to practically get permission, then how can permission be meaningful unless you say that it should just always be considered denied?\n\nThere's always going to be a judgement call. And, as I've said before, I have never seen you guilty of the sorts of approaches that I would call problematic. I think what matters is demonstrated compassion and understanding for the nature of the issues being discussed, coupled with a willingness to apologize if and when you make a mistake.\n\nTo be clear, I have made mistakes about this kind of conversation before. It's painful to realize that you've blundered in this way, but if you can find the courage to apologize and learn then you're doing all that any of us can do. These are difficult topics, and we're only human.\n\n&gt; Something being a legend or fairy tale implies that it's referring to events that didn't actually happen.\n\nWhat I mean to say here is that it's being treated as a story from the distant past. Unfortunately, the descendants of slaves live their ancestors' stories for generations after their deaths.\n\n&gt; Your link below on cultural appropriation doesn't say that cultural appropriation is wrong. [...] Since you linked to it, I assume you agree with its message?\n\nYes. What I should have said is that I think making the slavery comparison in a lazy and ignorant way constitutes a *mis*appropriation of the slavery narrative. For this reason, I would call the original post offensive in an objective and rational sense.\n\n&gt; I think a more productive way to address it would be to tell people that it causes hurt. I think that would work really well with vegans who tend to be quite empathetic. Also, most (non-black) people probably don't know exactly what to say to reduce that effect.\n\nBut I think that's how all these conversations started! Several people explained, in one way or another, that they were hurt by this post. But then others responded in a fairly predictable way — for example, one user explained that [people shouldn't be offended and this user doesn't care if they are](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4mw4e5/the_southern_argument_for_slavery_any_of_this/d3zmeot?context=3). That's a typical defensive reaction that shuts down discussion and makes the interaction hostile to people of colour.  And, by the way, how many people called this asshole out? Compare that number to how many people called out anyone who expressed any hurt whatsoever about the original post?\n\n&gt; I don't think that you can expect people to forgo making the comparison at all.\n\nI expect people who dare to use the comparison to do so carefully and to defend their use of the comparison if challenged. I think people who do not want to put in this effort should not use the comparison. I don't think that's too much to ask.\n\n&gt; *Is* there a disclaimer someone could add or something they could say that would make bringing up the subject less painful?\n\nYou have to actually put work into this. You can't just throw out the comparison and act all surprised when it pisses people off. You have to explain what it is you are hoping to accomplish with the comparison and why you are not doing anything awful like making a negative comparison between racial group X and animal species Y. You have to be honestly willing to engage with people who might have responses to what you have said and take *at face value* any claims that you've done something wrong.\n\nIf someone does say you did something wrong, you should say \"I'm very sorry and I didn't mean to cause offence, but I don't quite understand what the issue is. Could you explain it further, or give me something to read so I can better avoid making this mistake in the future?\" It didn't escape my notice that you're literally the only person in these comments that took this approach.\n\nI'll reply to your tangent in a separate comment.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "neither/mixed", "1.2.1_descriptive": "0", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "online community", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "against", "1.3.2_mechanism": "community standard", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 548, "comment": "The initial source of B12 is microorganisms that live in the soil.

You need to wake the fuck up. ***NOW***, before you end up doing yourself ***IRREPARABLE DAMAGE***! \n\n *But I don’t want to go back to eating meat or anything that hurts animals*. \n\n***YOU ARE AN ANIMAL***. You are a hominid primate. This is the full taxonomic entry for the primate [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human):\n\nDomain: Eukatyota  \nKingdom: Animalia  \nPhylum: Chordata (that means you have a backbone)  \nClass: Mammalia (you are a mammal)  \nOrder: Primates   \nSuborder: Haplorhini (the 'dry-nosed' primates)  \nInfraorder: Simiiformes (the 'higher' primates)  \nFamily: Hominidae (the 'great apes')  \nTribe: Hominini (includes the genera *Homo* and *Pan*, excludes *Gorilla*)  \nGenus: Homo  \nSpecies: H. sapiens   \n\n\n***You*** **are an animal**. You are hurting yourself by not eating the diet you evolved to eat. ***ALL*** great apes eat meat. Chimpanzees and bonobos eat other primates, gorillas eat small mammals and insects, orangutans eat fish. \n\nBeing vegan is ***INCREDIBLY SELFISH***. You have kidded yourself into believing that you're vegan because you \"care about animals\". You're an animal. You don't care about yourself (if you did you'd not be vegan). You need meat. Your gut bacteria evolved to digest meat, not plants (you're not even an omnivore; an omnivore is an organism which eats - and derive nutrients from - both plants and meat). Homo sapiens is a carnivore. The fact you're now suffering with kidney stones is testament to that, as is the fact that a vegan diet will eventually cause you further problems, even kidney failure (fancy dialysis...? Nope, didn't think so). I'm assuming you're in the US, the country where being sick is a luxury the vast majority can't afford. You are making a conscious choice to harm your health - what do you think will happen to your insurance premiums (if you can even find an insurer to cover you)...? \n\n***You are also making a conscious choice to curtail your lifespan***. \n\nLook at all the mammals and birds in the sub banner - ***ALL DOMESTIC.*** Do you have any idea how many heads of livestock there are on Earth...? ***AROUND THIRTY-TWO BILLION***. That's ***four*** for every human. \n\nRats in the genus *Rattus* are vermin (I don't care if they are cute, they are vermin. They're also omnivorous). I was part of a team in the UK tasked with extirpating rats from an island where rare ground-nesting seabirds colonised to breed. The rats outnumbered the birds about 100:1. We set traps. Every night militant PETAnists would come along and remove the traps. We received death threats, the team leader even received a dead rat through his letterbox. We had to go back with a police escort. We had to have security onsite 24/7. These birds are rare in the UK. I am in no doubt that vegans don't care about animals - if they did, they'd understand about conservation. \n\nFemale black and brown rats can have 60 offspring in a single year (which is fewer than the house mouse, but still a lot). In the UK it's estimated there are around 2 rats for every human (that's around 140 ***MILLION***). The seabirds I was tasked with helping to protect by killing rats (puffins, Manx shearwater, common, Arctic and little terns) don't even total 1m birds between them. Yet vegans cared more about the rats than the birds. \n\nRats in the genus *Rattus* are vermin. Not only do they prey on rare birds, they are vectors for several zoonotic pathogens, all of which are able to infect humans, and many of which can be fatal. There are species of rats which are extremely highly endangered (eg the [San Quintin kangaroo rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Quintin_kangaroo_rat) (*Dipodomys gravipes*) which is now only found in a tiny isolated pocket in Baja California, Mexico).\n\n  \n*Leptospira* (causes leptospirosis and Weil's disease)  \n*Toxoplasma gondii* (causes toxoplasmosis)  \n*Campylobacter* (one of the bacteria which causes dysentery)  \n*Yersinia pestis* (which causes bubonic plague)\n\nMy sister used to be a vet. She stopped being a vet because she had to PTS cats (her favourite animal) which had been 'veganised'. In the UK, there is a brand of plant-based cat-food called Benevo (tag: *animal-friendly animal foods*). Feeding a cat a herbivorous diet is just about as cruel and evil an act as you can do to a nonhuman animal. This food is endorsed by PETA (which has long since forgotten what the 'E' in its acronym stands for). Cats go blind; they develop cardiomegaly; their kidneys and liver fail. ***THEN THEY DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH***. That is vegans \"caring about animals\". Vegans believe that, if you start feeding a kitten on a plant-based diet, it will 'acclimate'. No, it won't. It'll fail to thrive and die before it turns one. \n\nHave you heard of anti-speciesism...? This is the belief amongst the more batshit vegans that no animal on Earth was meant to eat another animal. Anti-species vegans believe that a lion only eats zebra, gazelle, antelope and wildebeest because it's never been told how delicious grass is. Or that a wolf would be eating lichen rather than reindeer and elk if only it understood how nutritious it was...   \n\n\nAlso, if vegans truly cared about other animals, they'd understand the harm their lifestyle is doing to extremely rare species, such as the [Silky Sifaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silky_sifaka) (*Propithecus candidus*), the world's rarest primate. The Silky Sifaka is a lemur, so it's only found on Madagascar - I'll bet a large sum that no vegan who regularly posts here even knows what one looks like. The more people who become vegan because they can't ***BEAR*** the thought of eating little piggy-wiggies, or cowy-wowies, or sheepy-weepies, or chickie-wickies, the more of the Silky Sifaka's habitat will be lost to grow soya (which, as you have learnt, is toxic to humans in large quantities). Vegans won't face up to the fact that their lifestyle is actively harming the planet, they'll blame those of us who eat the diet we evolved to eat. I've not even touched on the fact that the carbon footprint of a vegan is worse than that of someone who eats how they evolved to eat. \n\nFinally, I'm ***STILL*** waiting for a vegan to address the one burning question: if vegans persuaded the entire human race to stop eating meat, how do they intend to stop domesticated animals (livestock) from breeding...? Or, if they're not going to stop livestock breeding, where are they going to put all the babies...? The future for the planet vegans seem to want is one with zero biodiversity. Just the entire Earth covered in domestic livestock. Domesticated animals can't be 're-wilded'; we have bred them to have traits that suit us (eg sheep with non-shedding fleece which vegans believe it's 'cruel' to shear (far less cruel to have a sheep slowly roasting to death, eh...?). Wild sheep shed their fleece, domestic sheep don't. Shearing isn't \"cruel\", it's vital for animal welfare). Just as we've bred cows, sheep and goats to always be 'in-milk' and so, if they don't have calves, lambs and kids, they develop mastitis. Milking dairy animals isn't \"cruel\", it's responsible husbandry. \n\nI am all for responsible farming practices (more so than vegans) but I recognise that I am, essentially, a carnivorous mammal and that means, to be healthy, I need to eat meat. \n\nAs do you, and everyone else on this sub (as do your carnivorous pets; if you want a pet, but don't want to eat meat, there are plenty of herbivorous animals you can keep: rabbits, rodents, agamid and iguanid lizards, equines, camelids, ducks, geese, parrots...).\n\nTl; dr The only way to stop recurrences of kidney stones, is to stop being vegan.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "against veganism", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "4", "1.3.1_reference_group": "other reddit user", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "against", "1.3.2_mechanism": "blame/shame", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 621, "comment": "1.

Religion has lost a great deal of power in the recent times, but it still is out there infecting minds and damaging people with the idea they are owned by a deity. Slavery is in effect alive and well in some respects. \n\n>The fact that slaves were owned by wealthier people doesn't mean that poorer people were against it.\n\nNo one said they were against it because they were poor. The issue is power dynamics. You are used to living in an age where you can anonymously badmouth anyone you want on the internet. Your social living sense has been permanently skewed by this. Damaged even. The folks back then had to live face to face, had to be an integrated part of their communities, rather than living isolated in a box and imagining their true community was all the people online that agree with them. \n\nIt's important to remember that slavery was not abolished by grass roots efforts, but by central authorities, like the British and United States governments, deciding that slavery would be stopped worldwide. One gained little trying to convince their neighbors with slaves to stop having slaves, but rather by convincing enough people in positions of authority that it would be politically, financially, and morally worth all the deaths that would result from fighting to stop slavery. \n\n>We're not talking about encouraging our child to condemn adults or badmouthing them\n\nThis OP has been talking about encouraging their four year old to question adults about their food choices.

Am I at fault for answering a question a child has no business asking? \n\nIdeally people back then taught their kids how to think, rather than what to think, and let their kids make their own decisions about what to value.

Thanks for stopping by, we welcome your questions.\n\nFirstly about the 'love\" thing. You don't need to \"love\" animals to not eat them and advocate for their rights. Think of it this way. You don't need to love minorities or homosexuals in order to fight for their rights / not harm them. I hope that analogy clears it up for you. It just comes from a basic form of respect that we grant toward humans but right now most of society doesn't grant to nonhumans.\n\nI'd like to quote Peter Singer:\n\n&gt;The portrayal of those who protest against cruelty to animals  \n&gt;  \n&gt;as sentimental, emotional “animal-lovers” has had the effect  \n&gt;  \n&gt;of excluding the entire issue of our treatment of nonhumans  \n&gt;  \n&gt;from serious political and moral discussion. It is easy to see  \n&gt;  \n&gt;why we do this. If we did give the issue serious consideration,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;if, for instance, we looked closely at the conditions in which  \n&gt;  \n&gt;animals live in the modern “factory farms” that produce our  \n&gt;  \n&gt;meat, we might be made uncomfortable about ham  \n&gt;  \n&gt;sandwiches, roast beef, fried chicken, and all those other  \n&gt;  \n&gt;items in our diet that we prefer not to think of as dead  \n&gt;  \n&gt;animals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Is it hard to be vegan and is it expensive to be a vegan?\n\nI went vegan 14 months ago. It was never \"hard\" for me because I went into this after learning how cruel the animal exploitation industry is. I always remembered footage like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko&amp;t=3763s) when i saw animal products and it reminded me deeply of why I was doing this. They say going vegan is easy when you think about the animals. Just my experience.\n\nI save money on groceries than I ever have. If you think about it, the cheapest foods in the store are inherently vegan. Think rice, beans, potatoes, frozen fruits/veggies, nuts, bananas etc. These are the foods that are also very healthy in the first place. The vegan meat/dairy alternatives can be expensive because they're processed and usually ready-made, but the same goes for a non-vegan seeking comfort foods at the store.\n\nIf you want to save money on a non-vegan diet, guess what, you still need to buy cheap foods like vegetables and beans and fruits to have a healthy well-rounded diet. All diets require money and planning.\n\n&gt;Lastly, how did you maintain self control from eating meat?\n\nI mentioned this before, but for me, it just came from a conscious moral conviction to not pay for the tremendous cruelty that happens to animals on farms and in slaughterhouses nationwide. I had a raw awakening within my \"soul\" and I vowed to never eat an animal product again. It's not even a thought now, the foods I eat nowadays are delicious. On top of that, vegan cheese/meat is there if I want that \"taste\".\n\n&gt;To be honest I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian and I eat meat but the thought of switching veganism have been playing in my mind for months now. The reason why I joined in this page, is for me to know and understand veganism more.\n\nI see, that's great. What do you think caused it to be on your mind more?\n\nThis is a good subreddit to learn about veganism. Also, consider our sidebar \"Wiki\" and using the search bar for other concerns or curiosities.\n\n&gt;I mean, I love animals so dearly but I am raised in a family with different beliefs from you guys plus I live in a country where meat is almost always in the table. I still have lots of questions but that's it for now.\n\nIf you think about it, we all hold the same belief. That we shouldn't harm animals if we don't need to. Due to years of conditioning and doing actions that are in contradiction with this belief (eating animal products) it makes it seem like we are a \"different breed of people\". The reality is that most people would never eat dogs or wear their skin, but somehow it became normal and justified to do the same to pigs/cows/chickens even though they are just as sentient and intelligent and capable of emotions as they are. This is essentially [speciesism](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2018/02/the-psychology-of-speciesism-how-we-privilege-certain-animals-over-others/).\n\nIn 2020 none of us really need to consume animal products anymore to be healthy or to survive.

That was the main consequence I got from the post, that participating in eating meat facilitates the process of these meat farms. Would you consider the goal being accomplished if I were to eat meat that I hunted myself from the wilderness, or purchased my meat from a free roam farm, where they take care of their animals and treat them properly?\n\nI think you might have missed a couple of key bits in /u/The_Real_Mongoose's reply there:\n\n&gt;&gt; The moral question is a matter of comparing the motivation for an action with the consequences of it. And most ethical models hold that causing suffering to another is immoral unless it's to avoid a similar or greater amount of suffering to yourself. So it's ok kill in defense and it's ok to eat meat to survive. But you don't need meat to survive. You don't need to to be healthy. You don't even need it to be happy; you may derive happiness from it, but there are other foods that would also bring you happiness in it's place. So the only thing you are protecting yourself from by eating meat is change.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hunting, as you mention, involves fewer of those consequences. There is less physical suffering, but the animals that we hunt still have social bonds. You would feel sad if someone killed your mother. Animals do too. Yes, animals will still eat other, and there will still be suffering, but that doesn't make it ok for you to cause more of it.\n\nDoes that make sense as an answer, do you think, /u/MetaMake? Or did I not grok something in all this?\n\n_\n&gt; That in itself would be a change that reaches the same target. It's a far step away from completely cutting all meat and living things from your diet of course.\n\nBut hey, while we're making changes, why not just go all the way? ^**=oD**\n\n_\n&gt; Is over population of wild life not a serious question? If we don't kill any of the deer or elks, would they not run rampant? The animals that feed on them would grow in numbers and size based on the mass amount of extra food around. Unless nature has developed some sort of equilibrium to balance out populations.\n\nAs it turns out, the population of \"sport animals\" is carefully manipulated in order to create a \"problem\" that is then \"fixed\" by killing these beings. So even if forcibly taking the lives of others might be put aside as an ethical consideration, hunting doesn't stand up as an ethically defensible activity. For more on this, [check out this well sources report on the issue](http://bitesizevegan.com/environmental-societal-impact/deer-hunting-overpopulation-solution-or-cause/). And here's [a report by the same author on the question of whether hunting is \"better\" than factory farming](http://bitesizevegan.com/ethics-and-morality/is-hunting-more-ethical-than-factory-farming/).\n\n_\n&gt; Also, how would the entire world converting to veganism prevent something like world hunger? Even with all the veggies and fruits, added with the meats, we have today isn't preventing famine. I believe that is a whole other issue that has to do with monetary gain, and greed isn't going anywhere because the world is vegan.\n\nWe're actually generating enough food in the world presently to feed every single person several times over. The problem is distribution, not production. However, even if that wasn't and issue, then ([quoting from our page on this issue](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/humans-would-starve-in-a-vegan-world/resources)) food scarcity is an argument for veganism, not against it. As the world’s population grows and more people are able to afford meat, less food is available overall. This is because we filter protein and energy-rich crops like soy and grain through animals at a substantial loss before eating them. Depending on the numbers you want to trust and the type of animal it comes from, each pound of meat requires four to thirteen pounds of feed to produce. By switching to a plant-based diet, the farms that presently grow that feed are able to grow food for people instead.\n\nIn all, roughly 40% of the world's arable land is used for food production, while only a quarter of that food is for human consumption. The rest, a staggering 30% of the world's arable land, is used to produce animal feed and commands a third of the world's fresh water. Worse, the meat resulting from this industrialized animal agriculture is not divided evenly. For instance, Americans eat 270 lbs. of meat a year on average, while Bangladeshis eat 4 lbs. Meanwhile, much of the world gets no food at all or raises livestock feed for export to countries with a high demand for meat, creating an unequal burden of production versus consumption between the poorest and richest people on the planet. This is why even conservative researchers are calling for a global decrease in the consumption of meat, while most are calling for the widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet in order to create and sustain food security for the world's growing population. Widespread adoption of a plant-based diet would leave the Earth's arable land and fresh water for use in the production of food crops for people and not feed crops for livestock.\n\n", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "other reddit user", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "pushing for", "1.3.2_mechanism": "other", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 706, "comment": "I'm aware of this, and I'm no fan of his, but I was speaking more generally about things I've personally heard people say when discussing veganism.

I still don’t know for sure if they were using all those chickens to contribute to their farm, but I feel that online we have to be pleasant and rational people. \n\nAlthough many people are addicted to outrage these days, I don’t believe it’s productive for us vegan activists, whether online or in person, to come across as being extremely critical of pro-plant-based businesses. I totally understand the criticism and in my mind, I’m constantly feeling like people in general are shit because of their apathy and selfish choices even after they see graphic footage of animal agriculture. Especially these large corporations that are capitalizing on plant-based eating while also selling animal products, such as fast food chains, Tyson Foods, etc. \n\nOatley has been extremely crucial in the anti-dairy movement though. That brand made its way into Starbucks, restaurants, grocery stores, many others. Without them, I doubt oat milk would have taken off the way it did. Let’s focus on the big picture which is to reduce animal cruelty and suffering. \n\nI was a marketing major and we did a lesson on marketing flops. There are so many! Often times they think a marketing campaign will be effective and it ends up backfiring within certain groups. I really do think they were trying to encourage non-vegans to at least try it out partial time, with the intent of fully transitioning to a dairy free lifestyle.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "against particular type/provider but pro veganism", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "people like me", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "neither/mixed", "1.3.2_mechanism": "blame/shame", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 729, "comment": "It sucks because it feels like the burden is put on us the consumers.

I was horrified by what I saw. Many of the images reminded me of things I had seen during my childhood, having been raised on a family farm.\n\nI literally went vegan overnight. I went through my entire house and rounded up every animal product I could find into a big pile and gave them to a friend who was a single mother. \n\nUnfortunately, I also lived in the middle of cattle country and factory farms for hundreds of miles and had no idea what I was doing and had absolutely no support system or way to understand the path forward. I ended up failing at veganism after a month or two.\n\nThe next few years I kind of coasted along through periods of what may be described vegetarian/reducitarianism. Eventually, I got to the point where I was only eating a few eggs a week and maybe a handful of cheese, trying to cut out unhealthy animal products from my diet. \n\nAround that time Soylent was getting pretty popular. It is supposed to be a meal replacement. When I learned that it was plant-based, I realized I could easily go 100% vegan and that's what I did. For about two months I ended eating nothing but Soylent. That was last February, so this February marked my first year of strict veganism.\n\nI really, really thought Soylent was some kind of super-health food. After a few months of it, vegans like /u/misskinky and Dr. Greger helped me understand the value of a whole-food plant-based diet, so I began incorporating those.\n\nFor the first few months of WFPBD, I had no clue what to eat or how to cook. I was basically just eating raw fruits and vegetables as they are. After a few months of that, I was able to stop taking a blood pressure medicine that I had been on for 13 years.\n\nAfter 3 months or so of WFPBD, I began to learn recipes that are both healthy and delicious. Sometimes, my meals are soo good that there just isn't enough time in the day to eat all the healthy, delicious food that I would like to.\n\nBut that introduced a huge amount of complexity to my life because there are a lot of moving parts to stocking and using a kitchen properly so after learning and practicing healthy recipes for a few months I eventually was able to drive up efficiency in my meal planning and preparation. It now only takes a few minutes to prepare a healthy, delicious meal, and sometimes I can even do a weeks worth in just a few minutes.\n\nAt a certain point I just began to kind of understand food.

This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.\nThe argument for modeling human behavior on non-human behavior is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried feces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival.

My response to this is then, so then what? You win, it's impossible, so why do anything at all? Or could we try and de everything possible and not let companies or people off the hook for doing shitty things? This argument to me is just lazy and defeatist and lets people feel better about being inactive. Look, I get that this world is very miserable and I afford people a lot of grace for not being able to take on all the problems that there are, but I think we need to stop saying things like \"there's no ethical consumption\" because it's just lazy. Of course there isn't, so what do we do about it. We've also seen that collective resistance and protests can make changes in the world, so we can make a world that allows for ethical consumption if we try.\n\n>\n\nUnfortunately I don't think we can prove this. While they are offering a replacement product and as much as veganism has become more popular over the last few years, the number of animals killed each year has also gone up. This article has statistics of all animals used and killed over the years and it continues to steadily rise:\n\nhttps://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/#:\\~:text=In%20the%20summer%20of%202023,in%202020%20was%2092.2%20billion.\n\nI get bummed out with these statistics as it makes me feel as if nothing is having an effect and I think it would be more wise to start pushing for closing factory farms instead of trying to please people's dietary preferences, but that is a much bigger debate to be had.\n\n>\n\nHow do you know that? What's to stop another company from doing animal testing to pass FDA regulations to create a \"vegan\" product. You would hope that a future company wouldn't have to, but if given the option they could take the Impossible route since it is a proven method to get a product to market, which is the issue that I have in the first place.\n\n>\n\nYes these modeling tools exist most likely due to past animal experimentation and that's because human's didn't have anything else to use in the past. As new technology is developed, the old ways should be phased out, especially if they are causing harm. Just like if Impossible had other avenues to get their product approved, they should have taken them instead of resorting to abusing animals.\n\n>\n\nTo me it just doesn't make sense for someone that cares about animals to accept abuse of animals for anything as frivolous as a fake burger patty. I get that you don't like them, but I am talking about the argument being made that \"these animals deserve torture so we can try and convince meat eaters that they shouldn't eat meat\". The mean doesn't justify the end. I don't believe in the idea that a few have to suffer for the greater good, that is the same language we always use about having power over the powerless, whether it is animals or people.

A dog or a human baby cannot be a vegan any more than a they can be a feminist or a marxist; i.e. if an individual cannot understand a philosophical position, they cannot be said to hold that position _regardless_ of how that individual is treated by others, and _regardless_ of the philosophical positions that those others hold.\n\nThis isn't an issue of debate. It's the accepted definition of the word. You could no more reasonably argue that the word \"mineral\" actually means \"pudding\" than you can that \"veganism\" is a \"diet\".", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 956, "comment": "Honestly my best advice, have junk food ready.

Yeah, it's terrible that animals are dying, and of course it's ideal if you went vegan overnight, but they don't understand how alienating saying this is.  Veganism already seems daunting to people, and saying that you HAVE to do it overnight if you *really* care about animals just puts people off, which in the long run causes more animal suffering, since it's so discouraging, and it reinforces the idea that vegans are gatekeepers. Hell, *I* was put off from veganism for a while because of this behavior, and I'm sure it's the same thing for so many others; Think of how many more animals we could save if so many people weren't assholes about this. Again, it sucks that animals have to die in the meantime, but if it means it'll save more animals in the long-run, then it's worth it.\n\nI don't understand the gatekeeping mentality.

A few make the transition overnight; for others, it will be a gradual process spanning weeks, months, even a year or more. Old habits are hard to break, and new habits can be hard to form. I went vegetarian for a year in 1995 before I went vegan on July 24, 1996. The only thing to keep in mind is to get to the state of total veganism sooner rather than later.

Things are changing so fast right now it's almost impossible to predict. Six years ago (2013) the Leaf was getting 84 miles to a charge, the Chevy Spark had just been out for a year with I think similar range, the MiEV with 62 miles...\n\nNow you have *multiple* offerings of 200+ miles, better&amp;faster charging networks, and so many more cars being offered in the next few years it almost defies prediction. However, one question that we can at least consider:\n\n&gt;How many miles are considered \"too many\" on an electric car? Is that even a question that can be answered?\n\nProbably, although more in the hypothetical range than anything else due to the smaller dataset and the number of miles involved. Modern electric motors are supposed to be rated in the 100s of thousands of miles; back during the EV-1 days one point bandied around was that some could last as long as long as a million (!), although I saw little direct evidence to back that claim up. I do know I spoke with a friend recently who only just traded out his Rav4EV (with 300k+ miles) for a Model X. Really, the main reason was that the Rav4EV's battery pack had died. IIRC some petro company bought the rights to the NiMH technology and buried it, so although the range was an issue that the batteries went kaput was the real problem.\n\n(Rumour has it Tesla can help with that but he felt one new car every 15 years was okay).\n\nFor others, probably a good question for the Leaf sub; I suspect there are folks out there with truly insane miles on their cars, battery degradation or not. Probably true for the early Teslas as well and other earlier EVs; the Bolt is new enough (2017) so there may be some people with 100k+ miles, but that would take 30k+ miles/year to pull off. Even with my high expected mileage - 20k+/year - even if I keep it as long as my Civic I won't break half a million miles. I will probably see some degradation; I've heard as much as 10-15%, meaning a max average range of ~200 miles.\n\nLong &amp; short is barring something unexpected with the batteries, you may be right - we may not be able to answer this question with anything more than educated guesses.

I took the time to answer in the first place because you seemed sincere.\n\n&gt;I am assuming by your answers that you are more middle of the road type of person on this subject, \n\nCorrect.  Some have called me a \"lukewarmer.\"  I simply try to take in as much of the whole picture as I can and strip away the politics, inasmuch as that's possible.\n\n&gt;...so what do you think would be possible solutions to our current CC problems and why?\n\nI'm glad you asked, honestly.  It's something I've given a lot of thought to.  That doesn't mean I have it all figured it out or that I don't have blind spots, but what follows is my considered opinion.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most importantly, we all need to take a deep breath.  The question of \"what should we do?\" often gets knee-jerk responses, which normally result in opposing knee-jerk responses.  I think we need to simply breath and think this thing through.\n\nNext, I think we need to recognize that potential solutions to climate change and potential solutions to peak oil/coal/gas have some overlap.  Those are worth looking at.\n\nAfter that, we need to not pretend that we have unlimited financial resources.  Everything we do will cost money, and once we choose to spend that money, we don't get to have that money to spend again.  We therefore need to get the most out of our money.\n\nI will assume here that most people want to maintain some semblance of modern society.  I know there are a few who think we need to revert back to a low-energy way of life.  I respect that viewpoint, and I wish those who wish to so live the best of luck.  I don't think most people want to live that way, and I believe that modernity has done more good than harm for humans, so I would like to have that persist for future generations.\n\nWith those caveats, let me revert back to bullet points for my recommendations:\n\n- While solar and wind are great for certain places at certain times, I do not believe they should be *the* general prescription for our energy needs.  Even very concerned climate scientists like Jim Hansen and Kerry Emanuel [agree on this point](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/).  Solar is great for hot, sunny places like Phoenix.  I think everyone there should consider rooftop solar, especially businesses.  I think there are places where wind makes sense too; however, both solar and wind are diffuse and intermittent.  They are simply not suitable replacements for coal- or gas-generated electricity.  \n\n- We would do well to electrify transportation as much as possible, but recognize that this will probably take a couple of decades.  I think this should be high priority since oil will peak much sooner than natural gas or coal.  I used to be critical of electric vehicles (EVs) and still am to some degree, but I will admit that they are approaching affordability.  If battery storage can continue to improve, I think they may become viable replacements for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars without subsidies.\n\n- Related to the previous, I think the densest urban areas really ought to implement [SkyTran](http://www.skytran.net/) or something like it.  Tel Aviv, Israel is building a test section.  Some places in the U.S. have considered it, but haven't yet committed.\n\n- I think current-level nuclear technology should be replacing retiring coal plants.  Natural gas plants are cheap to build and quite efficient when run in a combined cycle configuration, but I think fuel costs for those plants can only go up.  We still have very cheap natural gas because of all the money that was invested in exploration and production over the last decade.  That money has largely dried up, though, so natural gas plants won't have the cost advantage forever.\n\n- I think we really need to devote some resourced to exploring advanced nuclear options.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences has dusted off the work the U.S. did at Oak Ridge National labs 50 years ago and now has 400 scientists working on building two test Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTRs) by 2020.  (LFTRs are a type of Molten Salt Reactor, or MSR, if you run into that term elsewhere.)  They expect to have commercial reactors rolling off the line within a decade after their test reactors come online.  There are some other approaches to advanced nuclear as well, some of them fusion, that might be worth considering.\n\n- Large transportation ships should be allowed to have small nuclear reactors onboard.  Currently only military ships (and one Russian icebreaker that I'm aware of) are nuclear.  With some forethought, I think we could put sufficient safety protocols in place to allow for civilian ships to have nuclear reactors as well.\n\n- A good many environmentalists and peak oilers support many of my suggestions, but think the process should be goosed along by international treaties and carbon taxes.  In my opinion, neither are good ideas, nor likely to be widely adopted.  The former always break down into issues of reparations with developing nations demanding money from developed nations and developed nations not-so-subtly bringing up aid programs.  The latter (a carbon tax) is extremely regressive.  I've heard people say that the tax revenue would be simply be redistributed, but there are lots of problems with that idea, too.\n\n- Finally, I think we have a duty to help developing nations develop.  I have yet to see any evidence that a nation can develop without massively increasing its energy consumption, so I think we need to stop telling poorer countries that their only energy options are wind and solar.  They need the cheapest energy they can get.  I think we can get nuclear cheap enough and safe enough to do the job, but I don't think we should block financing for coal or natural gas plants at the present time.\n\nI know there are a few items that have slipped my mind because it's getting late and I'm forgetful even when well rested, but I think you get the shape of what I recommend.  I have considered the questions of nuclear waste and sufficient nuclear fuel sources and the other issues people bring up when I talk about nuclear power, so I can address those if you see those as hang-ups to my recommendations, but I think I've gone deep enough for tonight.\n\nKudos to you for asking hard questions and considering answers with an open mind.

They believed that there were too many issues for battery electric vehicles and that there would be breakthroughs in fuel cell technology to bring the costs down. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there certainly was some logic to that view. So Toyota continued to bet billions and billions more on hydrogen. By the time it was becoming clearer in the 2010s that they basically had bet on the wrong technology, they were unwilling to admit they had made a mistake.  \n\n\nThat they were going to go from being the leader in the next technology, to being very far behind so many other companies and having to spend billions to catch up.

I've only been talking about local chargers as replacements for L2. This whole thread started with \"If we just put a bunch of L2 chargers everywhere, then public charging will be solved.\" Not high speed chargers, no long distance trips. Not even a part of the discussion.\n\nSo many of this discussions are driven by people perceptions. Say DCFC and everything immediately locks onto \"Ultra high speed, charge as fast as possible, uber expensive, for long range travel only.\" It takes days to break down all of those preconceived notions. It took me 3 posts here to get you to see that I wasn't talking about 50kW chargers.\n\nI keep posting because I'm not fine with whatever gets built. Left to its own devices, the world will be blanketed with useless L2 stations. BTW a hotel should have 7kW L2 because they will be used overnight. It would be nice if they put a 25kW DCFC or two for guest that need to get a faster charge for one reason or another.\n\nI know I veered you off course talking about 25-30kW as high speed DCFC backups. But the hotel can illustrate an example. A place high speed DCFC and hotels. Conventional wisdom is the hotels have only L2. Situation occurs where travel DCFC is  completely out (and unfortunately with EA this has happened even recently). Next high speed DCFC is 100 miles away. Not enough juice to get there.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, one checks into the hotel, charges overnight, and then moves on, losing an entire travel day.\n\nBut if there's a 25-30 kW DCFC there at the hotel or other nearby location, a 90 minute charge can get you to the next high speed DCFC station. Sure it's lost time, but not the whole night. This should reduce charging and range anxiety.\n\nBut folks would battle until the end of time that the 25kW DCFC should not be put at the hotel (or apparently anywhere else). It should only be L2.\n\nSo, this is why it matters to me.\n\nga2500ev", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "other reddit user", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "against", "1.3.2_mechanism": "community standard", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 271, "comment": "Agreed..

A 100% tariff rate on EVs will protect American manufacturers from China’s unfair trade practices.  \n   \nThis action advances President Biden’s vision of ensuring the future of the auto industry will be made in America by American workers. As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda, the Administration is incentivizing the development of a robust EV market through business tax credits for manufacturing of batteries and production of critical minerals, consumer tax credits for EV adoption, smart standards, federal investments in EV charging infrastructure, and grants to supply EV and battery manufacturing. The increase in the tariff rate on electric vehicles will protect these investments and jobs from unfairly priced Chinese imports.  \n   \n**\\~Batteries, Battery Components and Parts, and Critical Minerals\\~**  \n   \nThe tariff rate on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5%% to 25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate on battery parts will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024.  \n   \nThe tariff rate on natural graphite and permanent magnets will increase from zero to 25% in 2026.

Concentration of critical minerals mining and refining capacity in China leaves our supply chains vulnerable and our national security and clean energy goals at risk. In order to improve U.S. and global resiliency in these supply chains, President Biden has invested across the U.S. battery supply chain to build a sufficient domestic industrial base. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Defense Production Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested nearly $20 billion in grants and loans to expand domestic production capacity of advanced batteries and battery materials. The Inflation Reduction Act also contains manufacturing tax credits to incentivize investment in battery and battery material production in the United States.

First, if you're not aware, Chevy [has an offer](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-level-2-charging-promotion-chevy-bolt/) where they will install a NEMA 14-50 for free with purchase of a 2022 Bolt or Bolt EUV. The catch is it has to be a 2022 I believe (doesn't hurt to ask the dealer about the 2021). The 2022 models are only just about to start deliveries and will probably command a premium over the 2021 models. So probably not worth it for you since you got a 2021 lined up, but just FYI. More info on a [recent Bolt thread here](https://www.chevybolt.org/threads/level-2-charger-install-subsidy-for-2022s.38663/). \n\nAlso, another FYI, there is a 30% federal income tax rebate for the cost of the cost of a charger + installation (up to $1,000). So, for instance, if you end up having the NEMA 14-50 installed for $1,000 and buy a $500 charger, you are eligible to get $450 back at tax time. [More info](https://www.chargepoint.com/resources/how-claim-your-federal-tax-credit-home-charging/).  \n\n&gt;I don't want to change an outlet to 240v and then find out later that it was an incompatible spot. There are four 120v outlets in front of my car but I think one particular one will be best.\n\nOkay, so I don't know what your setup is, but they will definitely run new wiring (i.e. a whole separate circuit) for your 240V 14-50 outlet. Typically this means adding an outlet, and not reusing anything involved with a 120V circuit. That's because the 240V circuit will require an additional wire and thicker wire since your 120V circuit is probably only rated for 15A or 20A. Does that make sense?\n\n&gt;Do you have any charger recommendations? I'll do a google search and read up about top 2021 chargers.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own any of these (I have a Tesla charger).

Lithium is standard currently? What else is being R&amp;D right now for other battery options? Is Li global supply adequate for years and years? \n\nRight now Lithium Ion is king, but there are promising alternatives that are making headway in the development stage. Solid State batteries are getting a lot of headlines, but they're still a number of years away. If the most advanced projects actually make it to mass-market production at all, they won't do so until 2025 at the earliest. There's also Lithium Air and Sodium Ion batteries, which I know little more than the names of, but which also look promising for later this decade.\n\nAs for lithium supply, there are new sustainable mining techniques being developed to let lithium be extracted from clay deposits that tend to exist in vast, empty deserts. So there are greener options coming, but for now the supply of lithium isn't the major constraint on battery production. It's the other materials, primarily Nickel and Rare Earths, that are going to be the bottlenecks for lithium ion battery production in the coming decade. \n\nIf you want to get a whole bucketload of info about all this, [The Limiting Factor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFn7ONIJHyC-lMnb7Fm_jw) has an excellent youtube series about Lithium Ion batteries.\n\n&gt; Fast charger companies. Who is making these?\n\nThe two biggest providers of DC fast chargers in the US are Tesla and Electrify America (which is funded by the government fines imposed on VW for the Dieselgate scandal). There are other fast charger makers like ChargePoint that are growing their fast-charger business quickly (they're largely known for the slower AC chargers), and also some local power companies built their own fast-chargers.\n\n&gt; How do you pay to charge your EV at a charge station?\n\nMost non-Tesla charging stations can be paid for just like gas stations, with a credit card swipe before you plug in. Tesla's Superchargers all connect to the Tesla servers and read your CC info from your personal Tesla.com account, so they don't have CC readers at all. You just drive up and plug in, and it all works automatically.\n\n&gt; ... and how much does it cost and how long does it take? \n\nThis depends on a number of factors. From my own experience with Tesla, charging at a Supercharger can cost between 50%-100% of the cost of fueling up a Prius (per mile driven), depending on time-of-day discounts and where you're buying gas. Though with gas prices through the roof lately, that might be more like 30-70% now, since as far as I know, Supercharger prices have not gone up appreciably.\n\nHow long it takes depends on how much juice you arrived at the charger with. This isn't true of every EV, but for Teslas, the chargers run a LOT faster when your battery is almost drained than they do once you've gone above ~60% charge. This is because slowing down the charge rate near the end leads to a much longer battery life, due to how much heat is generated at higher charge rates. \n\nIn my own experience on a road trip across the country last year, I spent no more than 20 minutes charging per stop (getting to around 60-70% charge), and generally got 2-3 hours of driving time between stops. Though I did sprinkle a few 50-60 minute charges into each leg of the journey, in order to get all the way back up to 100% while I ate a full meal. So I wasn't \"waiting\" to charge, as I was busy eating and would have been stopped anyway.\n\nOther EVs have much more variable maximum charging speeds, though. On the low end you have cars like the Chevy Bolt, which charges at a maximum of 55kW. Compare that to my Tesla Model 3's ability to charge at up to 250kW (when the battery is low), and you can imagine how much range there is in charging time. I've heard that a \"typical\" charging stop for non-Tesla EVs is around 30-45 minutes, though some (like the Audi E-tron and the Hyundai Ioniq 5) are much faster.\n\n&gt; When will see adequate fast charging stations on interstate highways? \n\nThey're largely already there. Most long-range EVs can make cross-country trips along the most common travel corridors today. And Teslas can make trips along less-traveled corridors as well, though other EVs will be able to do that, too, soon enough.\n\nIn addition, the US Congress recently passed an Infrastructure Bill that dedicated $7.5 billion to the built-out of a robust interstate charging network. Their plan is to make sure there's at least one EV fast charging station every 50 miles along all the Interstates. If I recall correctly, the majority of the funding is going to go to an 80% subsidy on the construction costs for EV charging networks that want to build public chargers that any EV can use, so they won't be owned and operated by the government. There are rumors that Tesla will request some of that money to retrofit their Superchargers with the cables necessary to charge other EVs, and open up their stations to be used by everyone.\n\n&gt; in my area, i can only think of 1 grocery store that tesla chargers right now. im sure there are others, but they are few and far between.\n\nCheck out the [Plugshare](https://www.plugshare.com/) app/website. It offers a comprehensive map of all the EV charging stations in various parts of the world. I bet you'll find that there are quite a few more chargers in your area than you expect. They don't need to advertise with big signs like gas stations, because EVs have them built into their in-car GPS. Most EVs just figure out which ones you need to use to complete your trip, and direct you to them automatically, including telling you how long to charge at each one.\n\n&gt; How long does an EV last without needing new battery? What is the cost of a new battery system?\n\nYou largely won't have to care about how much a new battery costs, because modern EVs don't have the problems that early Priuses and Leafs had, which is where the concept of an EV needing a battery replacement comes from. The vast majority of EVs will fall apart from wear and tear before their batteries die, so you simply don't have to worry about it.\n\nThat said, I used \"modern EVs\" there because many from before ~2015 are significantly less reliable in this regard. So if you're looking to buy a used EV, I'd avoid getting anything from before 2015, and especially avoid any Leafs from before 2017, which was when they redesigned the battery pack. If you live in a mild climate, the Leaf's battery cooling issues won't really be a big deal. But if gets really cold or really hot on a regular basis where you live, only newer Leafs are going to have good battery longevity.\n\n&gt; Investment opportunities in EV, battery mfg\n\n[The Limiting Factor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFn7ONIJHyC-lMnb7Fm_jw) youtube channel talks a LOT about how the battery space is going to change in the coming years.

Anywhere from 300 to 900 or more pounds. You’d need some sort of machine to move one around. They are not the size and weight of a suitcase. So yet more infrastructure would need to be built out, both to ship battery packs around as well as to handle them when swapping, plus you’d still need charging stations anyway to charge all the swappable batteries sitting around. It’s a lot cheaper to build just the charging stations or to install wiring for a charger at home.

But that’s not a price you ever get as a commercial electricity customer, not a price you get during the peak times of the day, and definitely not a price you get from DC Fast charging stations.\r  \n\r  \nDC Fast charging is expensive. It needs big, expensive chargers that cost as much as $100,000 each. The circuits to bring it in are expensive, and users with high sustained peaks — as chargers do — will pay even more. That’s why the car chargers that run from 50kW to 350kW tend to charge from 30 to 50 cents/kWh. Tesla promotes a megawatt charger for the Semi, and given past patterns, you can expect charging from that is going to come at a higher price.

Used pickup truck prices are usually pretty high, allowing them to stay in service longer.\n\nAlso brings up an interesting question.  Are we really relying on the used car market to filter EVs down to lower income people?  \n\nThe average age of cars in the US is 12.5 years old, which means there are plenty that are older than that.  A 15 year old ICEV can often still be fixed if something goes wrong with the powertrain.  A 15 year old BEV, through normal wear of the battery, could have potentially catastrophic battery issues that can't be repaired.  The battery will need to be replaced, and the question will be how much it costs, or if there's even replacement packs available.  \n\nThere's a very good chance that lower income people won't be able to justify the purchase of older EVs like they can today with ICEVs.  It's not just about potentially higher cost of repairs of an older EV, but whether it's a reliable form of transportation.  What if that original 300 mile range battery has degraded 30% and now only gets 210 miles?  What if the battery has built up internal resistance, causing higher charge/discharge losses... aka making it less efficient to operate?\n\nAll in all, it really suggests we could have some pretty big issues ahead of us.

Tesla produced about a quarter of one percent of the global vehicles in that period... an incredibly tiny number.\n\nYet, somehow they're touted as having done so much and gotten so far ahead.  In reality, the lion's share of those vehicles were produced only in the past 3 years or so.  So yes, they're ahead on production by a bit because they bought up the world's reserve of available battery production capacity, but they're not and haven't been ahead by anywhere near the amount some people claim they have been / are.\n\nAuto companies began spending billions of dollars years ago; but to know that, it would have required actually reading the news.\n\nNo... global OEMs do not produce 1.4 billion combustion cars per year.  1.4 billion is the number of cars in use today across the planet...\n\nAs to why OEMs didn't try to mass produce EVs sooner... that's because of the battery / electronic technology, raw material mining, and cell production hurdles that have been overcome in the past 15 years or so.  Even 11 years ago, it was thought that electric car batteries would require an enormous amount of Cobalt... for which the world simply couldn't produce much of, and would result in only tiny amount of electric vehicle production capacity that would ultimately just cost be a suck on company financials.\n\nFurther, major OEMs are not technology powerhouses and research centers... their purpose is to mass manufacture viable in-demand products.  Their transition started once EV technology was proven and as ways were found to reduce costs; namely with battery chemistry advancements that reduced cell costs and risk of fires.  And frankly, many OEMs started down a solid route for electrification development in the early-mid 2000s.  Namely small battery BEVs and Plug-in hybrids.  The problem was that new government regulations and subsidization priced those types of models out of the market versus long range BEVs.\n\nIn 2022, the world had enough cells to produce 8.6 million long range BEVs, 0 PHEVs, a fairly small number of hybrids, and the remaining 70 million or so vehicles would be ICEVs.  If instead we used all the global cell capacity  to produce plug-in hybrids and hybrids, we could have produced 36.5 million PHEVs, 45 million HEVs, and zero ICEVs last year.

In contrast to other electric vehicles, FCEVs produce electricity using a [fuel cell](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/fuel_cell.html) powered by hydrogen, rather than drawing electricity from only a battery. During the vehicle design process, the vehicle manufacturer defines the power of the vehicle by the size of the electric motor(s) that receive electric power from the appropriately sized fuel cell and battery combination. Although automakers could design an FCEV with plug-in capabilities to charge the battery, most FCEVs today use the battery for recapturing braking energy, providing extra power during short acceleration events and to smooth out the power delivered from the fuel cell with the option to idle or turn off the fuel cell during low power needs. The amount of energy stored onboard is determined by the size of the hydrogen fuel tank. This is different from an all-electric vehicle, where the amount of power and energy available are both closely related to the battery's size.\n\n[https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-fuel-cell-electric-cars-work](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-fuel-cell-electric-cars-work)\n\nIt is important to distinguish between Green Hydrogen from renewable energy and blue hydrogen from natural gas and gray/brown hydrogen from coal. They are not the same thing and Green hydrogen uses no fossil fuels and is not burned and produces no CO2 in the manufacturing or use of that fuel.\n\nWhen that hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources like solar and wind it is Green Hydrogen and does not come from fossil fuels and when used in an FCEV it is converted to electricity and the only emissions is water vapor.\n\nThere are major projects and lots of investment in green hydrogen all over the world right now:\n\n**Explainer: Why green hydrogen is finally getting its day in the sun \"More than $150 billion worth of green hydrogen projects have been announced globally in the past nine months. In total, more than 70 gigawatts of such projects are in development\"**\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/energy-hydrogen/explainer-why-green-hydrogen-is-finally-getting-its-day-in-the-sun-idUSL4N2II1O2](https://www.reuters.com/article/energy-hydrogen/explainer-why-green-hydrogen-is-finally-getting-its-day-in-the-sun-idUSL4N2II1O2)\n\nGreen Hydrogen is being promoted because it can replace natural gas and diesel for many uses including for big rigs, trains, busses, heavy equipment, planes, ships, home heating, making steel, construction and manufacturing of many products like glass.\n\nSo when you see an article about \"hydrogen\" make sure you understand if they are talking about Green Hydrogen from renewables or hydrogen made from fossil fuels as the fossil fuel industry and people promoting other agendas are intentionally trying to confuse people that they are the same thing and are actively using social networks like Reddit subs to spread that disinformation.\n\nGreen hydrogen is not likely to replace EV light duty cars because those can be charged at home and they are cheaper to build than an FCEV but for heavier duty vehicles and other uses that green hydrogen will be very useful in getting us off natural gas and diesel and it is important that we get off fossil fuels as an energy source for all uses.\n\nWhere is that power coming from to recharge your EV and power your homes?\n\nIf it comes from renewables it is clean energy and that excess renewable energy is also used to produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen production will greatly increase the expansion of renewable energy meaning your EVs will have more access to clean renewable energy for charging EVs and powering homes.\n\nIf your EV and home is being powered by a fossil fuel coal or NG plant it is NOT clean energy and you are still supporting the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWe need more renewable energy and to get off fossil fuels as an energy source for all uses.\n\n**How is green hydrogen transported?**\n\nGreen hydrogen does not compete with renewables and it compliments renewable energy as it gives renewable energy power producers a way to store excess energy and sell that as a product for many uses and it can also be converted to electricity, ammonia and fertilizer.\n\nWhen Green Hydrogen is converted to liquid ammonia it is very safe to transport and that is how they will be transporting it between countries.\n\nThe trucks transporting liquid hydrogen will also be powered by that same green hydrogen or batteries and we transport fuel every day to where it is needed.\n\nElectricity also has to be transported unless produced on site and with millions of new EVS and homes wanting clean energy that will require a massive build out of infrastructure that can cost billions and takes many years.\n\n**The Science Behind Using Ammonia as a Fuel**\n\n[https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1092](https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1092)\n\nGreen hydrogen can also be used to replace NG in appliances and that would allow countries to continue to have a backup energy source if electricity sources are at low production or not widely available:\n\n**Scottish homes to be first in world to use 100% green hydrogen**\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/scottish-green-hydrogen-fife](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/scottish-green-hydrogen-fife)\n\n**Summary or TLDR:**\n\nBatteries rely on mining of materials already in short supply and that will quickly become a serious bottleneck slowing down the transition to renewable energy if we rely on batteries for applications where green renewable hydrogen would be better suited.\n\nGreen Hydrogen is produced from renewable energy can replace natural gas and diesel for many uses and compliments renewable energy to help us get off fossil fuels as an energy source.

As always, it's extremely use-case dependent, and many people with emotional interests in a single solution don't want to accept that.\n\nIt's the problem with quoting averages: no-one is average. Average also doesn't tell us how many people are on either side of that average, or how far they are from that average, since we don't have the standard deviation or ~~mean~~ median, which could lead to all sorts of cases where it actually still doesn't make sense to buy an EV compared to, for example, continuing to keep a hybrid (which these studies seem to exclude from their comparisons, relying on pure ICE).\n\nBattery production emissions per vehicle are averaged as well, despite there being massive variability depending on vehicle and even trim level (and those vehicles in europe, on average, having lower kWh capacity than those sold in the US, on average).\n\nbasically, there's little value in trying to use averaged data to tell someone that their individual circumstances demand a particular solution, because averages are specifically not designed for that level of granular conclusion.

But now the industry is catching up.\n\nSame old argument. The industry is not catching up. Tesla is basically making close to a million electric vehicles in the US today. GM sees themselves there in 3 years. GM will catch up to Tesla in 3 years, to where Tesla is now, and that's assuming Tesla doesn't grow at all in the meantime.\n\n&gt;It’s fine if none of you people can see the bigger picture of the entire automotive industry.\n\nThe thing is, the automotive industry needs to radically change to accomodate electric vehicles. Electric cars are not just a different kind of ICE car, the outside looks the same but the inside is completely different. Everything that matters to make a car move is radically different. That's the bigger picture that most of the people in the ICE automotive industry fail to understand. Sandy Munroe made many great points [during his tear-down of the Mach E.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvWgXBtF614&amp;list=PLkiDlGyJnprddedqsVaco_kkBEMcToXy5). \n\nTesla spent years troubleshooting the mass production of electric cars, and they solved virtually all of those problems.\n\nMost other car manufacturers are just starting that process. VW had programming issues. Bolts spontaneously caught fire. Hyundai had a huge recall of batteries too. On top of that the fast charging network is rather bad.\n\nTesla meanwhile solved basically all the problems with their cars, and they just have to work on quality control to make sure there are no issues and panel gaps, and then they're golden. Far cheaper than troubleshooting the mass manufacture of new electric cars. Tesla has also been rolling out their own supercharger network, so Tesla buyers basically don't have to worry or care about the poor state of the charging network since Tesla is taking care of it.\n\nThe bigger picture of the entire automotive industry is far more than just how many car chassis can be pumped out of a factory. It's about a complete efficient new electric architecture, along with a charging network to support it.\n\nOther manufacturers are getting there, and I sincerely wish them to succeed so we have more electric vehicles to pick from, but we can't ignore that Tesla is better at making batteries and EVs than all of them, and basically makes more EVs globally than virtually everyone else combined.\n\nHow many ICE cars other car companies can produce is completely irrelevant, since EVs are a different beast entirely.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 549, "comment": "I wonder what impact wider adoption of EVs will have on fatigue related accidents.

Finally, both the naked “Z” and faired “Ninja” versions of the company’s planned pure electric models, due in showrooms next year, were on full display. Although detailed specifications weren’t revealed, Kawasaki’s 2024 “HEV” #hybridbike was also given a public outing.\r  \n\r  \nIt was formally announced that the two electric vehicles would go into production in 2023. To date, Kawasaki has only referred to the naked variant as the \"Z-family\" model and the faired type as the \"Ninja-style\" bike. Both have identical structural components, a steel tube frame, and an 11kW (15 hp) electric motor; in Europe, this qualifies them as learner-legal street legal bicycles. A 3kWh combined capacity from two batteries mounted in a compartment under the tank powers an electric motor that is installed in place of the gearbox typically. Instead of the standard four-speed gearbox used in Kawasaki's earlier electric prototype, this motor drives the rear wheel through a single reduction gear. There is no requirement thanks to the electric motor and single-ratio gearbox.\r  \n\r  \nWith the exception of the gasoline tank, which is no longer required, both the Z and Ninja models borrow their bodies from pre-existing vehicles, the Z400 and Ninja 400, respectively. The fork and wheels are off-the-shelf components from Kawasaki's current lineup, while the frame is a straightforward steel trellis design and the swingarm is a box-section item. When the bikes eventually reach dealers next year, Kawasaki will hopefully be able to keep prices down by sharing components.\r  \n\r  \nA more intriguing button with the moniker \"eBoost,\" which Kawasaki has long trademarked, may be found on the right handlebar. This is meant to activate a different power mode that combines the use of the combustion engine and the electric motors. The bike's dual powertrains allow it to run in either pure petrol mode while traveling and charging the battery as it goes, or in pure electric mode for short, low-speed city journeys utilizing a very tiny battery pack located under the seat.

It is an absolute truth that you are on your FIRST scooter and odds are it won’t be your last! \n\nTake the time now to get to know your scooter, go over it with a fine tooth comb - check every nut, bolt and screw🔩. If any are loose, grab a bottle of blue locktite and tighten them down. \n\nLearn what the appropriate tire pressure is and spend some time learning about batteries. If you won’t be able to ride immediately because of weather, don’t charge your scooter above 80%, if it will remain put for awhile. \n Learn about the program settings (often referred to as P-settings). Make a copy of the table to easily access on your phone when you’re out so you can adjust the scooter when on a ride.\n\nSpend some time watching maintenance videos so you aren’t overwhelmed the first time you need to work on your vehicle. \n\nDon’t rush into riding it on wet, sloppy roads - water and electronics really don’t mix regardless of the ip rating. \n\nSpend some time setting up your cockpit. Brace your scooter against a wall so it’s correctly upright and move your controls until they are right for you. I have my display almost flat horizontally, my brakes are at about 15 degrees down off flat as I\nlike my wrists to be in a natural position.\n\nNow is the time to think about the accessories you want. First is a mirror and second is headlamp. Only a very few scooters come with sufficient lighting for night riding. After that I’d suggest a stem bag to hold the little things you’ll want with you, a multi tool, a little air pump, a beverage bottle unless your planning on adding a drink holder, and a phone charging cable if your scooter has a USB port (check around the base of your display- there may be one hiding underneath). I put in a mask, hand sanitizer and finds.\n\nNicites would include a phone holder, a beverage holder, a loud horn, and a gps tracker. I also have clip on red lights for my pack and I want to add turn indicators this winter. I have motorcycle frame sliders on both wheels - they have taken the brunt of a couple of spills - saving the main tub of the scooter from being scuffed up and the brake calipers from damage.\n\nBuild yourself a ride kit, many of us use a backpack or a sling bag. I have 2 - a small bag where I put in the items I’ll need for an emergency - a very small bottle of tire repair sealant, my air pump, a bottle of disinfectant and a couple bandages (never have needed them but my granddaughters have), etc. My big pack holds the little one along with an emergency poncho and large garbage bag for sudden rainstorms, a spare inner tube, my windbreaker for weather changes, a fast charger, lock, disc brake alarm and cable so I can lock up during stops. I bring this pack on long rides / day trips out of the immediate area.\n\nWhen you can get out with your scooter- FIRST find a quiet stretch of road or a parking lot and practice braking. Practice at different speeds, but practice practice practice. Practice until emergency stopping is something you don’t have to think about! Stand with your hips down and to the back, knees and elbows bent. Keep your feet in line, front to back- not side by side. Use your body to manage the stop - not just your hands pulling on the stem. Remember to use your back brake first so you don’t end up flying over your handlebars. \n\nSpend time on turns - the faster you make a turn the more you will need to understand about counter steering. Turning is done primarily with your body, not with the handlebars.\nThen you will start to feel comfortable on your scooter. It is NOTHING like a child’s kick scooter - it looks easy but remember it’s a real vehicle hitting real speeds and a tumble will hurt!\n\nPractice starting up the scooter as well as stops. Some scooters have a kick to start function which can be turned off in time - a zero kick start, hit the throttle and off you go. That can be dangerous if you accidentally bump the throttle or hit the throttle when grabbing the handlebars or hit the the throttle instead of the brake, all of which most of us have done when first riding.\n\nMy final thoughts are as my role as the Safety Police I’m accused of being! First, dress for the fall, not the ride. Number one is a MIPS technology full face helmet. If your scooter can go faster than 20mph buy a motorcycle helmet. If your scooter is regulated to 15mph then a full face mountain bike helmet may be sufficient. \n\nWhile learning, gear yourself up! Elbow and knee pads, wrist guards and gloves. Wear decent footwear. I liked my hiking boots early on because of the ankle protection. Many new riders chew up their ankles before the realize where the deck is when standing next to the scooter and when starting and stopping. I also wear full finger gloves under my wrist guards and I also have gloves with wrist and palm protection built in - check out skateboard gear to find quality scooter gear. If you enjoy music, consider an external USB speaker or bone conduction headphones like  AfterShokz so you can still hear the environment.\n\nRemember to ride as if you are invisible- to many drivers on the road - you are! They drive on auto-pilot, they drive distracted, they are listening to music, eating, looking for an address, angry with their boss, their spouse. They don’t think before opening a door when parked, they encroach the bike lanes trying to park, they don’t think we can go as fast as we do so cut in front of us to make a turn. And most of all —- they don’t see us as a threat to their safety. So ride with the intent of getting to your destination and back home again safely!", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "1", "1.2.2_injunctive": "3", "1.3.1_reference_group": "people like me", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "pushing for", "1.3.2_mechanism": "community standard", "1.3.3_second_order": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 724, "comment": "Dunno, I ordered a model Y back in February and it's still on order.

There is in fact a very clear reason why the existing Tesla connector can’t support more than 500V.

The charger adjusts the voltage output to target a certain current flow. In other words, the charger supports a certain range of voltages, not one or the other.\n\nBut yes, you’re right about difficulty.

Why? Regardless of the whole political debate, where fantastic BEV quotas (battery electric vehicles, note) and so forth are used, there is no continent where customers' reluctance to buy electromobility is as high as in Europe.\n\n&gt;STANDARD: What are your thoughts on that?\n\n&gt; Fröhlich: We call that cognitive dissonance. There are official reasons that are: infrastructure is not good enough. Cars are too expensive. Supply is too small. The ranges also. The true reasons can be defined with three letters: Total cost of ownership. How much does the car cost me? What is the maintenance cost, what is the residual value, is this technology already robust, do not come any uptates that will make my car worthless in four years. For example, we have difficulties in fleets of companies that want to lower their carbon footprint, introduce PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles, Note), or BEVs. Why? They have their card of a mineral oil company and with which they can refuel for free. And if they would charge their electric car at home, they would do that only if there was a comparable service. That's the true motivation. Total cost of ownership decides. You can also see it: if subsidies are high, the demand goes up, when it comes to an end, for example, the Netherlands, the demand collapses completely. Completely. That means: Europe will need the diesel, will need 48 volts, will need plug-in hybrids. Because, only via battery vehicles, we will not get ahead - although at the moment everything is highly subsidized: All electrified vehicles from BMW are significantly lower margin than the ICE, but the demand does not increase. I hope that at some point once the ecological and economic reason returns, and then the diesel has to get another chance. But it will surely disappear from the smaller market segments.\n\n&gt; STANDARD: You mentioned plug-in. Among other things, there is the lack of range to mention - and I drive two systems at the same time walk, so pack up properly mass again. The cars are therefore getting heavier. Is the weight spiral even reversible?\n\n&gt; Fröhlich: Point one: You are right with the ranges. But at the moment we have a doubling of energy density every five years. This not only benefits the battery vehicles, but also the plug-ins. That's why the X5, which will be available as a plug-in next year, has an 80-kilometer (80-kilometer) WLTP range so it will come to around 60 depending on how it drives. It also increases the recuperation performance. I think that's attractive. Second point: I can not quite confirm that. Because I think we are the only company, and that was also a concern to me, where we are always lighter with the successor vehicles than its predecessor. The 7er was net 100 to 120 kg, the 3er's 55th We are the only ones who have already reversed this weight spiral by using intelligent lightweight construction. The other is that as energy densities increase, they do not reach reach by making the battery heavier, but the space and battery remain the same, but the chemistry changes. Cell monitoring. And if you integrate a plug-in hybrid, which we are the only one in the Archtiektur, they also have no functional disadvantages. Our competition packs the plug-in hybrid battery in the trunk. But that does not mean battery, but trunk, but it should be used. It is also driving dynamics not so good, if you drive a large battery behind the rear axle through the area. In that sense, I believe that the total benefit to the customer with a plug-in hybrid is very high in Europe. Compared with a battery-powered vehicle that is not purchased, a lower-yielding car that is purchased and contributes to CO2 reduction is still better.\n\n&gt; STANDARD: You pioneered the i3, 2013. The next steps do not sound so pioneering. Is this also related to your experience that no one really wants to buy an e-car, so you rather rely on plug-ins and look at the development first?\n\n&gt; Fröhlich: I think we are pioneers. We have been consistently advancing - perhaps invisible to the public. We have enabled the architectures that every car can do anything. Every drive. The other is: I am currently developing the fifth generation of electric drives. In i3, the second one was in it. If you take a closer look at what we are doing there in terms of cost degression in the system - e-machine, for example, without rare earth, with high efficiency, cell monitoring, how can I reduce the cost of the whole store with thermal management: there we are cost leader! I break up every competitor that comes to market somewhere and look at it. It's unusual for BMW, but we're the cost leader. If they are not cost-effective in e-mobility, they will not survive.\n\n&gt; STANDARD: Why is that important?\n\n&gt; Fröhlich: Because we will have very different developments in the geo-regions in the next 20 years. In China, there will probably be a BEV population on the East Coast, which can be more than two-thirds, both on the regulatory and customer side. This is not possible in western China. It's going to be very mixed in the US: California yes, but in certain regions where the customer has a stable barrel price of less than three dollars a gallon through fracking: he's going to drive V8, he has no reason. If the e-car is not sexy for him, who wants to have fun, why should he buy it? In Europe, especially in Germany, I do not know how it is in Austria, there is a lot of discussion and the least action. And regulation is still the most inefficient. That's the reality. And that's why: If I build a 7-series, I can not afford to develop one for China and another one for the US.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "against particular type/provider but pro EVs", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "none", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "none", "1.3.2_mechanism": "other", "1.3.3_second_order": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 940, "comment": "Same here.

This is according to statistics from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) and represents an increase of 93.4 per cent compared to 2021.\n\n&gt;The statistics distinguish by type of drive: among the electric vehicles sold were 5.365 million battery electric vehicles (+81.6 per cent), 1.518 million plug-in hybrids (+151.6 per cent) and 3,000 fuel cell vehicles (+112.8 per cent). In total, sales of these examples accounted for a quarter (25.6 per cent) of all vehicle sales in China. The overall Chinese vehicle market grew by 2.1 per cent. Important to know: The CAAM figures include commercial vehicle sales in addition to passenger cars.\n\n&gt;Exports from China in 2022 totalled 679,000 NEVs, just under 10 per cent of the electric vehicles manufactured and sold in the country. According to the CAAM, exports thus reached an increase of 120 per cent compared to 2021.\n\n&gt;Among manufacturers, BYD is the undisputed leader. The group sold 1,863,494 NEVs last year (including 1,857,379 passenger cars), which is +208.64 per cent more than in 2021. At the time, BYD recorded almost 600,000 NEV sales. In terms of car powertrains, BEVs and PHEVs balanced each other out in 2022: BYD sold 911,140 battery-electric and 946,239 plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\n&gt;Tesla also improved strongly year-on-year. In 2022, the US-based company sold 710,865 BEVs built in Shanghai – 439,770 stayed domestically and 271,095 were exported. In the previous year, total sales of vehicles produced in China were 473,078. The relative increase from 2021 to 2022 is thus 67 per cent.\n\n&gt;GAC Aion is establishing itself as the third-largest electric vehicle manufacturer with 271,156 BEVs sold last year. This represents an increase of 126 per cent for the manufacturer, according to CAAM. Other OEMs followed are Volkswagen Group with its China production (155,700 BEVs), domestic manufacturers Neta (152,073 BEVs), Nio (122,486 BEVs), Xpeng (120,757 BEVs), Leapmotor (111,168 BEVs) and Zeekr (71,941 BEVs), as well as BMW (41,886 BEVs) and Smart #1 (9,212).\n\n&gt;The large increase at Neta (from 69,674 to 152,073 BEVs) and Leapmotor (from 43,121 to 111,168 BEVs) is noteworthy, while the sales increase at Nio and Xpeng is rather moderate. The Geely brand Zeekr, which has only been delivering since October 2021, makes it to eighth position from a standing start.\n\n&gt;Volkswagen and BMW are interesting from a European perspective. While the Volkswagen Group sold 70,625 NEVs manufactured in China in 2021, it sold 155,700 units last year. “China made the largest contribution to the group’s global BEV growth with its increase in deliveries,” the Wolfsburg-based company says.

The Model 3 still seems to sell pretty close to MSRP even on the used market so that's out.  But I'd pay particular attention to the used market because you said you can't capture the full rebate.\n\nMy advice first is to go test drive them and prowl around the cars.  I think they all drive pretty well but there's no replacement for driving  yourself - plus it's fun.\n\nA 240V plug install would likely run in the $400-1000 range and the thing that determines how close to the bottom or the top of that range is the distance from the panel to where you want to put the plug.  If your main breaker panel is close - within a dozen feet - then you'll be at the lower end of that, and if it's on the other side of the house then it will be on the higher end of the range... and could even be higher if it's an older house.\n\nThere is one more idea that I didn't see anyone mention and that would be to generate tax liability.  If you own any stocks that have appreciated a lot, you could cash them in and rebuy and then pay off the capital gains - since you'd pay this gain eventually, this helps you out.  If you have a regular IRA, you could convert to a Roth IRA and that generates a taxable event and a Roth is more useful than an IRA.  If your parents have enough tax liability, you could dual title it with them and let them claim the credit and give you the cash back.\n\nThe other thing would be to buy a PHEV - with some of the newer ones you could cover half the commute on battery power alone.   And they are usually substantially cheaper than a full electric.  And with most - like the Prius Prime - you'd get substantial fuel savings as well even when it's running in gas-powered mode over your V8.\n\nActually if you want my advice, personally I think I'd buy a hybrid and wait for EV's to drop in price a bit.  Get a used Prius and you'll save more money than you would with an EV.

There's only \\~570,000 metric tonnes of SNF in the world. That figure includes low-level and mid-level, but that's actually great because that's the figure we need to more accurately compare it with solar waste.\n\n&gt;Show your math please.\n\nLet's do the math then, using [your source](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-nuclear-waste-storage-france/). At the time France had 58 operating nuclear reactors (now 56) providing 72% of its electricity, which means in order to provide 100% of its energy France would be generating give or take about 2.8 kg of nuclear waste per person, with its twice-through fuel cycle.\n\nNow the US uses more energy than the average Frenchman. We use about 12,071 kWh per person per year versus France's 6,448 kWh per person per year, so about 1.9 times more, meaning the average person here would generate 5.3 kg of total nuclear waste per person. We have 329 million people so that's 1,743,700 metric tonnes of nuclear waste per year (I remember now in the old estimate we just multiplied France's usage by the number of people in the US, that's how it came out to 330,000).\n\nAbout 9,885 Metric Tonnes of that would be Spent Nuclear Fuel in a twice through fuel cycle, or 11,565 metric tonnes of that in a once through fuel cycle. The majority of the rest of this figure is low level, medium level, and refining/reprocessing waste since this constitutes wastes in France itself, and not all of this is actually radioactive. Mining waste and possibly decommissioning waste don't seem to be included in this figure.\n\nSo now we can compare it to what we know of Solar's life cycle waste.\n\nIn order to generate 12,701 kWh per capita per annum with Solar Energy you would need enough solar panels to generate 47,070 kWh per annum assuming the average capacity factor of 27% (you would need more actually at 100% renewable but that's a TON of math to calculate losses, curtailment, etc. etc. so we'll skip that for now). That figure varies across the US but we'll be generous and use the average (most solar farms are currently located in sunny places like the Mojave which skews it a bit high). That means you'd need 5.3 kWe of Solar Panels per person. The average utility-scale 72 cell solar panel has a 25 year lifespan, weighs about 22.8 kg, and has an output of about 370 watts (I actually had to calculate that myself from [here](https://www.solarelectricsupply.com/solar-panels/72-cell-solar-panels)). That means you need about 14.3 solar panels per person, times 329 million people, times 22.8 kg per panel. So that's about 107,267,160 metric tonnes every 25 years, or 4,290,686 metric tonnes per year. Solar panels are creeping up towards 32 year lifespans, so if we assume a 32 year lifespan, that's 3,352,099 metric tonnes per year.\n\nSo in short, Utility Scale Solar generates 1.9 to 2.5 times as much waste, although I don't have figures for solar mining/refining or Uranium mining. I think Nuclear decommissioning is probably covered in the mid-level waste above though, considering the size of the value. But even if we take those into account, Solar is still either slightly more or about the same.\n\n(1/2)", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 14, "comment": "From your own link q/a #14  \"Interest expense is not part of the expenditure for qualifying property under \r\n§ 25C or § 25D.

Since my project has already been delayed for months for other reasons, I’ve had a lot of time to think and see the next generation of Enphase inverters (IQ8) come out.\n\nI’m mostly worried about clipping because my system has a high DC/AC ratio (1.38) by using 400w panels (11.2DC: 8.12AC), and because I’m located in SE Florida where there’s lots of sunny days.\n\nI’ve been debating with them over doing this. Initially they were like “sure”, but after they came out with an install schedule they’ve been pushing back against it. Here's what they've said:\n\n&gt;I did speak with Greg moving to IQ8.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Engineering decides on the most optimal inverter model for a solar design.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Since we have panels on roof faces on different directions, moving to IQ8's will not make a big difference in output losses due to clipping.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Using the IQ8 with larger output, could actually decrease your power production, since these models require a certain minimum amount of irradiance to turn on, so you might lose some power generation in the morning and evening hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Changing to IQ8's right now, would require us to redo engineering, calculations, and resubmit permits etc which will add months to your project.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Greg's recommendation is to stick to the IQ7+s. You want to get grandfathered into the old Net Metering before DeSantis signs that crazy net metering law. I would not delay at all in Florida.\n\nObviously the company wants to get this done and avoid extra costs, but I can’t tell if they are exaggerating the costs of switching just to avoid doing it. Only changing the name of inverters on the system doesn’t seem like it would take “months” or cost much in redesign.\n\nThat’s why I want to ask you guys.

These tenants were looking to move in this summer which just can’t happen now. If they could add a large solar array and battery storage and work with the utility to interconnect it with the grid since they will have much lower peak draws, reduced grid power consumption, and have power available to sell it would be possible to get occupancy.

I just wanted to skip down to the area where he talks about why the author thinks nuclear power is bad. In the few paragraphs there, i could tell that he was making false assumptions.\n\n&gt;nuclear power plants continuously emit low levels of cancer-causing strontium-90 radiation during “normal” operations, and higher levels when there are serious problems such as the continuing leakage of radioactive water from the tsunami-damaged reactors at Fukushima, or the radiation leak that lead to the instantaneous closure of the San Onofre nuclear reactor in Southern California in January 2012[8]. \n\nNow, one thing that is wrong is that nuclear power plants do not release any strontium-90 isotopes into the environment during normal operations. Sr-90 is only produced as a direct fission daughter of the fuel. Any of the Sr-90 that is created is contained in the fuel cladding and will not escape unless there is a fuel leak, which is very rare. In that case, it would still be contained in the primary coolant which is highly controlled as well. In the extremely rare case that there is damage to the primary piping, it would still then be contained in a containment building. The only plants that have every had any Sr-90 released into the environment are Chernobyl and Fukushima. Three Mile Island had a fuel and primary system failure, but it was all contained in their containment building.\n\nThe mention of San Onofre's leak was an ammonia leak and it did leak some low level contamination into their secondary system, but not into the environment. The isotopes of concern in that case were not Sr-90 or any other fission daughters since there was no fuel damage, as the leak was in the steam generators. \n\n&gt;Today, even as radiation levels surge in Japan, media pundits discuss the dangers of radiation as if radiation sickness were limited to instances in which people experience nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or death. This is false. A host of studies show that radioactive emissions of deadly strontium-90 during nuclear plants’ routine operations increase cancer rates among those who live near the plants, especially in women and children.[9]   (See Appendix A, Average Strontium-90 in U.S. Baby Teeth, 1954-2013.)\n\nThe Sr-90 that was released into the environment as mentioned in the studies is a direct result of fallout from nuclear bomb testing during the cold war, not nuclear power generation. They mention this in the studies.\n\n&gt; nuclear power plants are not “carbon free.” They do not emit carbon or other greenhouse gases as they split atoms during the fission process, but their carbon footprint must be assessed on the basis of their complete nuclear fuel life cycle.\n\nHe does have a point here, but you could say the same thing about renewable energy. Wind generators are notorious for requiring a lot of maintenance and materials for a lot less power output. Solar panels also degrade and fail after a period of time, reducing their cost and material to power generation ratio. Nothing is really immune to this. Solar is improving a lot and may be a great contender as its efficiency increases, but it is really only useful in very sunny areas. Until that efficiency is improved, nuclear still has a better cost and materials to power output ratio.\n\n&gt;In addition, the nuclear industry’s false refrain that nuclear power plants have no carbon footprint is an attempt to obscure the fact that nuclear power plants’ radiation footprint is far more lethal than the carbon footprint of any other industry.\n\nIt is a little known fact that coal plants regularly put out much more radiation and contamination than nuclear plants do. If he was speaking only about renewable energy industries in this statement, then he would likely be correct.\n\nI did not bother reading any further after this.

We looked at things based off a 5 year model 30% rebates/30% equity/5 years of savings what is the cost and is that worth it.

You're a retail customer AND a raw materials supplier, and you want the same selling price for the raw materials as you're paying for buying finished product.

Unless you have solar panels on your roof.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 172, "comment": "The typical off-grid setup is \n\nsolar panels connected in (optional) parallel (optional) strings that feed into a charge controller (typically mppt) that is attached to an array of (optionally) parallel set of (optionally) series batteries which then attach to an inverter that feeds a circuit.\n\nFor instance my setup is 2 strings of 4 100W panels that feed a 100 volt 50 amp MPPT into 4 parallel pairs of 12 volt batteries in series that then attach to a 24V inverter.\n\nThings get tricky because \"average PV hours\" assumes you have an infinite place to dump power.  In an off-grid setup for instance you might not run down your batteries when sunlight is low.  But sizing typically works like\n\n1.  What is your typical load\n2.  How long do you want to run it\n3.  How low do you want to discharge your storage.\n4.  How much PV hours do you get\n5.  How often do you get overcast/etc.\n\nFrom 1-3 you can size your storage.  For instance, for AGM batteries you want to only discharge to 80% (if you can help it) to have a decently long cycle length (honestly think of AGMs as UPS batteries not off-grid living batteries).  So a [say] 200W load for 4 hours would need 800Wh / 20% =&gt; 4kWh of storage (about 340Ah of 12V batteries).\n\nBut then factor in how many days between sun you might have.  In Canada in the fall for instance you can easily go 2-3 days without significant PV.  So say 3 days,  So that's 2400Wh meaning to keep &gt;80% SOC you need 12kWh of storage.\n\nThen you have to design your solar to match that.  If you're in Canada and you get say 4 PV hours per day say twice a week (this excludes hours which your PV array won't meet your load/charging needs).  Means you get 8 PV hours a week.  To run this load 7 days a week you need to generate at least 5600Wh of energy in 8 hours which is 700W of panels.  Then you have to take into account shading and angles/etc so you might be only 80% efficient on your location (for instance my setup is high 80% in the sun).  Realistically I'd bump that by 50% at least so plan to install north of 1kW of panels.  But that's just to meet load.  If you want to keep the batteries topped up it's a whole other song and dance...\n\nSo I guess the questions are\n\n1.  What load are you trying to run\n2.  How often\n3.  How much solar do you have installed\n4.  How much battery capacity do you have\n\netc...\n\nTo give an example, my setup is for my home office (on sunny days) and as a small home UPS to run the fridge/freezer/etc during blackouts.  So I have 1.6kW of panels (800W installed so far 800W soon ...) setup as 2 (soon 4) strings of 4 panels that feed into my MPPT that feed into my 8 105Ah 12V cells paired up into 24V pairs.  I have 10kWh of storage so in theory I could use ~2kWh regularly while still having 1500+ cycles.  I don't though.  I only use it if the sun is out or we're in a blackout so I rarely discharge more than ~5% or so.\n\nI used AGMs instead of li-po or lifepo4 cells because they're a heck ton cheaper and easier to install (no BMS needed).  The downside is unlike say lifepo4 I can't discharge as much as often.  If I were trying to maximize off-grid time in my office I would have gone lifepo4 but then the cost of the storage setup would have gone up 3 to 4x (honestly, as a UPS AGM batteries are just fine).\n\nI originally planned on keeping 800W for a while but got another 800W of solar because I really didn't factor in cloud coverage.  On a partially cloudy day my 800W array [in the fall] can barely and many times not keep my office load (200-300W) going.  So another 800W should allow me to go off-grid most days.  It also means during a blackout we have extra generation capacity.\n\nSome easy rookie mistakes to avoid\n\n1.  Make sure your inverter is pure sine.  They cost more than modified sine but you'll end up regretting your cheaper MSW purchase when you end up buying a pure sine\n2.  Buy an MPPT charger that is more than your planned capacity.  You might only have [say] 200W of solar today but might want to double or triple that later.  \n3.  Breakers.  Use breakers on everything.  Any connection to or from a power source (solar, batteries, etc) should have at least one breaker.  Don't skimp on this.\n4.  Ground your inverter.  \n5.  Ground your solar panels\n6.  Use proper cables.  Your inverter should be fed from something decently thick like 2/0 AWG.  Your charger should be using at least 6AWG to your batteries.  Your solar should be no higher than 10AWG.  \n\nOne of the stupid mistakes I made (several times) was trying to cheap out by buying small and then upgrading later.

You are just optimizing for fewer bills. Which is a valid financial choice.\n\nI tend to optimize my financial decisions around building equity. Which is riskier than minimizing bills. In my case, it makes sense to get the solar panels much earlier before I had a lot down rather than using my excess savings to build equity, I am using part of my power bill to build equity. \n\nIn any case, paying cash or financing, solar panels are pretty much a no-brain. So long as you have a decent solar roof and a decent net-metering rate. \n\nThe upside of paying cash is your monthly bills are lower. With rooftop solar, you should be getting about 5% return on your investment, which is pretty good. And it should stay pretty stable even if the solar panels degrade because electricity prices will likely inflate. The downside is your cash is tied up in the solar, which means it'll be a little hard to access (refinance the house). If you are fine with that, then mostly cash is the way to go. \n\nSomeone else mentioned net metering. But I want to discuss it a little deeper. If you don't have a good net metering rate, it can really diminish your returns. For my personal system in Colorado, I probably return 50% of my electricity to the grid. And I'm a full electric house with AC, and a Tesla. Texas might be a little bit better, but not a whole lot. Even with your AC running full blast on a 3-5k square foot house, it probably only draws an average of 3-5 kw (for a \\~5 ton system). So you'd likely be pumping back 5-10kw to the grid for a significant portion of the day. \n\nSo you definitely want to factor in your net metering rate to your financial calculations. If they give you crappy net metering rates (like the wholesale rate of \\~$0.04/kwh), it could turn your 5% yearly return into a 3% yearly return. \n\nIf you need a battery, well you need to factor that in too. With a big system like yours, you'll need 3-4 powerwalls to soak up that energy every day, because your system will likely average 100-120kWh per day in the summer. Even if their price drops in half (for a powerwall), that really does effect your financial calculation (as it'll still cost 15-20k to get them installed - with prices 1/2 what they are today... which might not happen for 5 years). And then, getting a powerwall later isn't the most efficient way to get battery added because you'll have two inverters. Essentially the micro-inverters and the powerwall inverters. It should be cheaper to get only one set of inverters.\n\nAnyway, those are a couple of my other thoughts on that.

It's certainly far above BMW, Mercedes, etc. levels, but could they sell in amounts like Ford, GM, Toyota, etc.? I don't think so.\n\nAnd that's even sort of assuming all you care about is the class of vehicle. Part of choice is so you can pick the manufacturer that offers the features and designs you want. Want a remotely reasonable priced, road-trippable BEV *sedan* but dislike the Model 3's minimalism? You have *no* choices.\n\n&gt; EV Model Availability\n\nThis is a joke right now. The only car that is usable in road trips in the US at a price that is even remotely reasonable for the majority of car shoppers is the Model 3. A sedan. That immediately closes something like half of the market. Even if you remove that restriction and start counting things like the Model X and even PHEVs like the Outlander as an SUV, the top three best selling autos in the US are all pickups. There's no EV pickup.\n\n&gt; Cost Competitiveness With ICE Vehicles\n\nNot even close for most people.\n\nMake no mistake -- for the vast majority of people, the Model 3 is still a *very* expensive vehicle, even taking TCO into account. If you drive 150 miles a day? Yeah, it will make financial sense for you to buy. If you're comparing to a BMW? Sure, it will do very well in that comparison. But if you drive the average 12-15K year and are debating between that or a Camry or Accord? The long range Model 3 has no chance. Once $35K one materializes that will compare favorably in terms of price, but lots of people will be unwilling to buy because of the range, which I'll get to next. Drive *less* than average? You're many many years away from a Tesla-capable EV being cost competitive for you.\n\nWhen I said that I think without cost drops I think Tesla won't be able to sell like the big manufacturers, this is what I meant.\n\n(And I should also say: being cost un-competitive will be OK for *some* people who are willing to pay a premium for the environment or something like that, I just don't think that will be *that* many people. Ditto for performance if we're looking at the population of people buying Camrys. EAP would do it for some people, but you're not getting that at the base price.)\n\nIf you ask me, something in the 300 mile range (or lower but substantial improvements to charging speed and level 3+ charger locations) at the $35K mark is where EVs actually start to win here. If you save $1K/year for ten years on fuel, that would put the TCO around a $25K car. (I'm unwilling at this point to consider maintenance a win for Tesla compared to an Accord, Camry, etc.) Right now that's $53K; if we subtract $5K for the premium interior, it'd be at $48K. Tesla needs almost a 30% drop in cost to get there.\n\n&gt; Range, Charging Infrastructure, and Charging Speed\n\nI'm bundling these all together because they're pretty tightly related -- you can make up big losses in one with improvements in another, especially range and charge speed.\n\nTesla does pretty well here, but I assert mostly only in the long range version. (This also means I think the Bolt, Kona, etc. have a couple generations to go.) \n\nI am more demanding than most here, but for trips that I care about, based on A Better Route Planner's routes (Tesla's online trip planner gives much worse results), even the long range Model 3 or Model S represent a noticeable compromise, adding close to an hour to my annual Christmas trip relative to an ICE due to charge time. The mid range is about an hour and a half longer, and the standard range about two and a half hours. The last *definitely* makes that trip \"infeasible\" to do in a day, by which I mean I would rather rent an ICE car than take a standard range Model 3 that I already owned. The mid range is probably in that area, and I'm skeptical that I'd prefer to take even the long range 3.\n\nSo, what will make *me* ready to buy a BEV in terms of capability? Excellent charger placement would make the long range into basically no compromise, and put the mid range into borderline territory. (What do I mean excellent placement? Installations at most or all of the service plazas on the Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio turnpikes in sufficient numbers that I could be pretty guaranteed that I could get one without waiting, even on a peak travel day.) Doubling charger speed would do about the same; tripling it would make the long range *better* than ICE, the mid range about the same, and the short range would become an acceptable compromise. For range, about a 50% increase from the current long range would also do it. Finally, of course multiple of the above could be combined. And for *me* all of that would need to happen at the $30K-$35K price point.\n\nNow, I've said before I suspect my own needs are far enough away from the ideal BEV customer that I'll be on the back half of the adoption curve for a full BEV even though there are better than even odds I'll soon buy a PHEV, but even with more normal needs where the current long range Model 3 is acceptable it still needs to be there at a far better price point. I'm *not* convinced that something around 250 miles range will work given today's charge speeds.\n\nEven TFA author says they expect 400-500 miles to be needed.\n\n(A couple disclaimers. First, part of my problem is that I'm in the north, so there's a hit to range and charge times relative to someone in the southern US; if I lived in New Mexico or something, I'd be less demanding. Second, of course all of the above is relaxed if you're willing to either rent when you go on a trip, or you are in a household with multiple cars. But in those cases, then you don't even need to go to Tesla; something like the Leaf will serve you well.)\n\n&gt;  Gas Prices\n\nThere's... not even anything to solve here, assuming you're in the US. Not only can't you and that'd be arguably undesirable, gas prices here are actually pretty low.\n\n&gt; Battery Supply and  Battery Technology Breakthroughs\n\nThese are *definitely* not solved. The former not being solved is the main reason that most EVs have extremely long waiting lists and limited geographical availability.\n\n&gt; Economic Conditions and China\n\nAgain, there's nothing to solve here.\n\n&gt; California\n\nI'm not even sure this should be on the list, TBH, at least separately.\n\n&gt; Government Bans/Regulations and Government Incentives\n\nThe situation with these is perhaps even degrading, not improving, considering the governments that are removing or having expiring credits.\n\n&gt; Automaker Leadership and Commitment, and Dealer Training\n\nThis situation is improving, but very slowly; Tesla is the only manufacturer for which this problem is solved (and of course they never had it in the first place).\n\n&gt; Utility Commitment/Programs\n\nI'm not sure what the state is here. My utility has no EV program, but I don't know if they're common or uncommon, on their way in or on their way out, etc.\n\n&gt; Growth in Green Energy\n\nThis varies by location. It's certainly not solved in much of the US. According to [the Union of Concerned Scientists's map](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner), I may be in the dirtest grid region of the country. Many traditional-hybrid sedans (e.g. the non-plugin Accord or Camry hybrids, to say nothing of the Prius or Ioniq) will have noticeably lower CO2 emissions than a BEV run from my mix of grid power. In most of the US, the best hybrids (like the Prius or Ioniq) will outperform a BEV on grid power *for now*.\n\nThat being said, it's definitely moving in the right direction, and often remarkably rapidly.\n\n&gt; Vehicle to Grid Adoption/Battery Storage\n\nThis one is actually *very* intriguing, and I actually kind of wonder if that might be a way I could get some extra \"mileage\" out of a BEV, because my car often stays parked in my driveway all day. (Did I mention I'm a particularly ill-suited customer for a BEV?) If that could make a few hundred bucks a year by charging at night and feeding the grid at day -- I'm not sure if it could, but it might be worth thinking about -- without spending even *more* money on a powerwall or something because I already have a car, that might make the cost effectiveness point turn a bit earlier for me. Hmmm.\n\nAnyway, I don't know how to call this in terms of solved or not. :-)\n\n&gt; EV Charging Standards, Terminology, and Convenience\n\nThis is *definitely* not solved, and arguably the Model 3 makes it worse -- for the S and X, at least Tesla provides a CHAdeMO adapter, but that doesn't work for the 3.\n\n&gt; Consumer Awareness and Education\n\nDefinitely not solved, though again we're moving in the right direction.\n\n&gt; Purchase/Finance Models\n\nAlso not solved at this point in the case of the Model 3, because Tesla doesn't lease them.\n\nNow, that said, for other EVs the story here is great because a lot of EV leases have been very favorable. I also fully expect Tesla to change their policy when their production capability finally gets to the point where they can satisfy demand, and they actually need to start actively trying to attract people.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 233, "comment": "This article in short:\n\nA concentrated solar plant is now obsolete because?\n\n\\*shock horror\\*\n\nRegular photovoltaic solar panels have gotten so much cheaper.\n\nIs this bad for the people who built the plant?

As most know there's a lag in demand compared to production in the afternoon and evening. This leads to high swings in wholesale cost to the co-op. They offer a pretty nice incentive of $250/kWhr of capacity for a battery (and a great deal if you buy a Tesla Powerwall through them\\*), and my inverter will take power from the battery when the panels stop producing. This will flatten the \"duck curve\" and take away peak strain. Most people aren't going with batteries because of net metering, which is available in Colorado, but I have some ethical concerns with selling power to my co-op at retail rates, since it potentially harms people who can't afford the capital outlay of solar or don't have the opportunity due to renting, etc. Plus if enough solar gets installed I'm sure net metering will go away anyway.\n\nThe second function, which is what got me interested in this whole project to begin with, is back up power. This involves installing an automatic transfer switch between the main breaker and service panel that will supply power to the panel (or sub panel with critical loads) if grid power drops. It is necessary to have an ATS to isolate the house panel from the grid for safety. I was going to build a DIY critical load rectifier/inverter system but since I'd be using used equipment with unknown history I thought it better to go with something that had a guarantee (what's the point of a backup after all), and why not get the rebates, tax deductions and free electricity too?\n\n\\*Why not get a Powerwall at over 50% off? Well, because to get the deal you have to install three of them (way overkill for my home), the co-op will control them to actually feed power back to the grid during peak times, and they require $1million liability on your homeowners insurance.

Here is a [different source](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/nuclear-reprocessing-dangerous-dirty-and-expensive) from the US stating it in other words:\n\n>reprocessing does not reduce the need for storage and disposal of radioactive waste, and a geologic repository would still be required. Plutonium constitutes only about one percent of the spent fuel from U.S. reactors. After reprocessing, the remaining material will be in several different waste forms, and the total volume of nuclear waste will have been increased by a factor of twenty or more, including low-level waste and plutonium-contaminated waste.\n\nA Reuters article on the [reprocessing in France](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/france-seeks-strategy-nuclear-waste-site-risks-saturation-point-2023-02-03/):\n\n>Since the launch of the site at La Hague in 1976, it has treated nearly 40,000 tonnes of radioactive material and recycled some into nuclear fuel that can be re-used. The waste that cannot be recycled is mixed with hardening slices of glass and buried for short-term storage underground. But its four existing cooling pools for spent fuel rods and recycled fuel that has been reused risk saturation by 2030, according to French power giant EDF (EDF.PA), opens new tab, which runs France's 56-strong fleet of reactors, the world's second biggest after the United States.\nShould saturation happen, France's reactors would have nowhere to place their spent fuel and would have to shut down - a worst-case scenario that led France's Court of Audit to designate La Hague as \"an important vulnerability point\" in 2019.\n\nHowever, I don't take issue with your arguments for nuclear power, rather with your strong statements against renewables like this:\n\n>Let's just do oil and gas mark 2!

In anticipation of a storm, you can also tell the system to keep the batteries charged and use grid power. I would also say that you're not tied to the Enphase battery system. There are tons of setups out there with Enphase microinverters and Franklin batteries or Powerwalls and many battery systems are capable of working AC coupled.

It can provide some amount of power without a full battery system. You'll have some limits because the output from your panels can swing pretty wildly. They could be making 10kW and a cloud could come by and suddenly you're down to 2kW.\n\nYou can also get a portable battery that can accept solar power and buy a couple standalone panels that you could throw on the ground to charge the battery during the day. You could also get some use out of a setup like that if you go camping.\n\nI'm in Houston and I think you'd be surprised at how affordably you could get an interlock and a generator socket installed at your house.

Smithfield Foods is the largest pork producer and processor in the world. It has facilities in 26 U.S. states and it employs tens of thousands of Americans. It directly owns 460 farms and has contracts with approximately 2,100 others.\n\nBut in 2013, during the Obama/Biden Administration, a Chinese company bought it and its subsidiaries, for $ 4.7 billion, and that means that the Chinese will now be the most important employer in dozens of rural communities all over America.\n\nThanks in part to our massively bloated trade deficit with China, the Chinese have trillions of dollars to spend. They are only just starting to exercise their economic muscle.\n\n It is important to keep in mind that there is often not much of a difference between “the Chinese government” and “Chinese corporations”.  In 2011, 43 percent of all profits in China were produced by companies where the Chinese government had a controlling interest in.\n\nLast year a Chinese company spent $2.6 billion to purchase AMC entertainment – one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States. Now that Chinese company controls more movie ticket sales than anyone else in the world.\n\nBut China is not just relying on acquisitions to expand its economic power.\n\n“Economic beachheads” are being established all over America. For example, Golden Dragon Precise Copper Tube Group, Inc. recently broke ground on a $100 million plant in Thomasville, Alabama. Many of the residents of Thomasville, Alabama will be glad to have jobs, but it will also become yet another community that will now be heavily dependent on communist China.\n\nAnd guess where else Chinese companies are putting down roots?  Detroit.\n\nChinese-owned companies are investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology, selling everything from seat belts to shock absorbers in retail stores, and hiring experienced engineers and designers in an effort to soak up the talent and expertise of domestic automakers and their suppliers. If you recently purchased an “American-made” vehicle, there is a really good chance that it has a number of Chinese parts in it. Industry analysts are hard-pressed to put a number on the Chinese suppliers operating in the United States.\n\nChina seems particularly interested in acquiring energy resources in the United States.\n\nFor example, China is actually mining for coal in the mountains of Tennessee.\n\nGuizhou Gouchuang Energy Holdings Group spent 616 million dollars to acquire Triple H Coal Co. in Jacksboro, Tennessee. At the time, that acquisition really didn’t make much news, but now a group of conservatives in Tennessee is trying to stop the Chinese from blowing up their mountains and taking their coal.\n\nAnd pretty soon China may want to build entire cities in the United States just like they have been doing in other countries.  Right now, China is actually building a city larger than Manhattan just outside Minsk, the capital of Belarus.\n\n Are you starting to get the picture?\n\n China is on the rise. If you doubt this, just read the following:\n\n*  When you total up all imports and exports, China is now the number one trading nation on the entire planet.\n*  Overall, the U.S. has run a trade deficit with China over the past decade that comes to more than 2.3 trillion dollars.\n*  China has more foreign currency reserves than anyone else on the planet.\n*  China now has the largest new car market in the entire world.\n*  China now produces more than twice as many automobiles as the United States does.\n* After being bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, GM is involved in 11 joint ventures with Chinese companies.\n*  China is the number one gold producer in the world.\n*  The uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team were made in China.\n*  85% of all artificial Christmas trees the world over are made in China.\n*  The new World Trade Center tower in New York is going to include glass imported from China .\n*  China now consumes more energy than the United States does.\n*  China is now in aggregate the leading manufacturer of goods in the entire world.\n*  China uses more cement than the rest of the world combined.\n*  China is now the number one producer of wind and solar power on the entire globe.\n*  China produces 3 times as much coal and 11 times as much steel as the United States does.\n*  China produces more than 90 percent of the global supply of rare earth elements.\n*  China is now the number one supplier of components that are critical to the operation of any national defense system.\n*  In published scientific research articles China is expected to become the number one in the world very shortly.\n\nCiting the nonpartisan economic think-tank Paulson Institute, an American Security Institute report underscores that \"Chinese firms and investors own a controlling majority in nearly 2,400 U.S. companies.\" In addition to owning Smithfield and its subsidiaries, General Electric Appliance Division, IBM, General Motors, Spotify, Snapchat, Hilton Hotels, AMC Theaters, Tik Tok, and many others -- purchases that predominately occurred during the Obama/Biden Administration -- they also own The Chicago Stock Exchange, Legend Entertainment Group (movie studios... maker of such films as Jurassic Park), The Waldorf Astoria, Strategic Hotels and Resorts, Riot Games, Motorola, Ingram Micro (distributor of iPhones), Sheraton Universal and Marriott Downtown in Los Angeles, Terex Corporation (earth moving equipment that used to be owned by GM), Teledyne Continental Engines (aircraft powerplants), Morgan Stanley, VISA, Blackstone, Ford, Chesapeake Energy, and American social news aggregation site Reddit.\n\nMost of the money borrowed by the U.S. Government comes from China and we pay it back with interest. All of the spending Biden wants to do for his \"infrastructure plan\" and is doing will be done WITH MONEY BORROWED FROM CHINA. In 2015, at the tail end of the Obama/Biden Administration, China had an estimated $4 trillion of foreign reserves stashed away in various foreign investments. The United States was the largest recipient of Chinese money back then.\n\nSo the next time you wonder why China has such influence, even in the US, you will already have an idea why.\n\nIn recent years, the Chinese have regarded America as one big yard sale, snatching up distressed companies and anything else that gives the world’s second-largest economy a leg up on U.S. technology at bargain-basement prices. That giant shopping spree is financed by a currency that -- unlike the dollar -- is controlled by the government. \n\nPresident Donald Trump was well aware of this. He labeled China a “currency manipulator,” slapped its products with huge tariffs and promised to bring back jobs from overseas.\n\nHowever, by owning U.S. businesses, the Chinese control the products these companies produce and the people they employ. Dislodging China’s grip on American business will require a lot more than tough talk.\n\n• Richard Cole", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 291, "comment": "Just tow a massive trailer full of batteries, covered in solar PV panels.

Divide by 365. Divide again by your areas average peak sun hours. This should be your minimum targeted system size for panels. Do the same thing, but do it by month based on expected loads (watt usage expected in that month/ days in the month/ average peak sun hours in that month). Take 110% of the max number found. This is your 'never want to run out of power' size.\n\nTake this info, plus your architectural drawings to a good local solar installer and see what they advise.

Summer in its Western Peninsula barely lasts two months and gets maybe 10 degrees above freezing for just a few hours a day. Not even Mr. Gore or UN computer models talk about raising Antarctic temperatures by 85 degrees F year-round. So how is that ice supposed to melt?\n\nThere are factors other than ice melt that determine the rate of decline of ice sheets. [Ice streams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_stream) are a significant feature of the Antarctic polar cap, and the speed of their flow increases with temperature.\n\n&gt; Let’s not forget that sea levels have risen 120 meters since the last Ice Age ended. Do the global warming alarmists think cave men fires caused that?\n\nObviously not.\n\n&gt; Obviously, powerful natural forces caused those ancient glaciers to come and go – and caused the droughts, floods and climate changes that have affected Africa, the Earth and its animals and people for millions of years.\n\nSee [Milankovitch cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles).\n\n&gt; Just consider northern Africa, where green river valleys, hippopotami and happy villages suddenly got turned into the Sahara Desert 4,000 years ago. Scientists don’t know why, but it probably wasn’t Egyptian pharaohs building pyramids and driving chariots.\n\nActually, scientists have a [pretty good idea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_event) what caused the [Neolithic Subpluvial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Subpluvial) to end.\n\n&gt; However, the real problem isn’t questionable or fake science, hysterical claims and worthless computer models that predict global warming disasters. It’s that they’re being used to justify telling Africans that we shouldn’t build coal or natural gas electrical power plants. \n\nNot true.\n\n&gt; It’s that the almost total absence of electricity is keeping us from creating jobs and becoming modern societies. It’s that these policies KILL. \n\nCorrect, [policies that prevent communities in Africa from gaining access to reliable sources of electrical power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_developing_countries) should be changed or abandoned.\n\n&gt; The average African life span is lower than it was in the United States and Europe 100 years ago.\n\nNot true. Life expectancy in the US in 1912 was 53.7, whereas average life expectancy in Africa in 2012 is 53.8 (55.8 in Uganda). More to the point, carbon emissions per capita in Uganda are currently at 0.11 tonnes - far, far lower than they were in the US in 1912. \n\n&gt; But Africans are being told we shouldn’t develop, or have electricity or cars because, now that those countries are rich beyond anything we Africans can imagine, they’re worried about global warming. \n\nNot true, again.\n\n&gt; The world needs to go on an energy diet, Al Gore and UN climate boss Yvo de Boer tell us. Well, I have news for them. Africans are already on an energy diet. We’re starving!\nAl Gore uses more electricity in a week than 28 million Ugandans together use in a year. And those anti-electricity policies are keeping us impoverished. \n\nWhich anti-electricity policies?\n\n&gt; Not having electricity means millions of Africans don’t have refrigerators to preserve food and medicine. Outside of wealthy parts of our big cities, people don’t have lights, computers, modern hospitals and schools, air conditioning – or offices, factories and shops to make things and create good jobs. \n\nAll very true.\n\n&gt; Not having electricity also means disease and death. It means millions die from lung infections, because they have to cook and heat with open fires; from intestinal diseases caused by spoiled food and unsafe drinking water; from malaria, TB, cholera, measles and other diseases that we could prevent or treat if we had proper medical facilities. \n\nAll very true, again.\n\n&gt; Hypothetical global warming a hundred years from now is worse than this? \n\nPossibly.\n\n&gt; Telling Africans they can’t have electricity and economic development – except what can be produced with some wind turbines or little solar panels – is immoral. It is a crime against humanity. \n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, China and India are building new coal-fired power plants every week, so that they can lift their people out of poverty. So even if Africa remains impoverished – and the US and Europe switched to windmills and nuclear power – global carbon dioxide levels would continue increasing for decades. \n\nThat depends on how fast emissions grow in the developing world and how quickly they fall in the developed world. \n\n&gt; Even worse, the global warming crusaders don’t stop at telling us we can’t have electricity. They also campaign against biotechnology. As American, Brazilian and South African farmers will tell you, biotech seeds increase crop yields, reduce pesticide use, feed more people and help farmers earn more money.\n\nNot true - no GMO under cultivation has provided an increase in crop yields.\n\n&gt; New varieties are being developed that can resist droughts – the kind Africa has always experienced, and the ones some claim will increase due to global warming.\n\nAnd new varieties of non-GM indigenous crops are being developed by institutions in Africa to meet these future needs at much less cost.\n\n&gt; Environmental radicals even oppose insecticides and the powerful spatial insect repellant DDT, which Uganda’s Health Ministry is safely using (along with bed nets and modern ACT drugs) to eliminate killer malaria. They claim global warming will make malaria worse. That’s ridiculous, because the disease was once found all over Europe, the United States and even Siberia. \n\nI didn't realise that the [World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/globalchange/climate/summary/en/index6.html) were environmental radicals.\n\n&gt; Uganda and Africa need to stop worrying about what the West, the UN and Al Gore say. We need to focus on our own needs, resources and opportunities. \n\nAgreed, as long as there is a clear mechanism for getting agreement between Africans on what their needs are.\n\n&gt; We don’t need rich countries promising climate change assistance (maybe, sometime, ten years from now), if we promise not to develop. \n\nI'm not aware of any such proposals.\n\n&gt; We need to stop acting like ignorant savages, who thought solar eclipses meant the gods were angry with them, and asked witch doctors to bring the sun back.\n\nThat's a pretty poor generalisation of Africans.\n\n&gt; We need to stop listening to global warming witch doctors, who get rich telling us to keep living “indigenous,” impoverished lives. \n\nYes, don't listen to hypothetical global warming witch doctors.\n\n&gt; We need trade, manufacturing, electricity and transportation fuels to power modern industrial economies.

Don't you remember that we've been through this? \n\nI do.  You seem to be the one forgetting it.  \n\n&gt;The energy transition in Germany added only a tiny amount to the average households energy bill—what was it, 12 Euro?\n\nThere was no energy transition.  Germany had already built out a very nice nuclear power system.  There was a nice addition to this system of highly subsidized renewable energy (mostly wind), but now that nuclear is being phased out in favor of coal, the real transition will begin.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I cannot fathom how you can conceivably call coal power cheap when there are studies which show that coal power is not, in fact, cheap. \n\nMy perspective on this is from being in countries without reliable electricity.  The benefit from coal-based power *to those countries* would be far greater than its costs.  \n\n&gt;It's three times more expensive to society than what it shows on your power bill.\n\nI don't think it is quite that high.  \n&gt;Since renewable energy is already cheaper than that, let's all rejoice.\n\nThat is blatantly false.  There *is* a form of power generation that is as cheap as coal, but without most of the externalities.  It is really the only way there will be a significant reduction in CO2 emissions while leaving economies intact.\n\n&gt;Germany has arguably spent the most on its energy transition and yet there is no economic \"destruction\" at all, on the contrary, they're doing wonderfully.\n\nCorrection.  They *were* doing wonderfully by subsidizing an industry they could export to the world.  When China decided to produce solar panels, German companies started to go bankrupt.  If their success was based on their green policies, why have they abandoned them?\n\n&gt;In regards to Australia, the carbon tax has not destroyed the economy either.\n\nOf course not.  They are a fossil fuel exporting nation that doesn't tax the carbon they are exporting.  They will continue to do well for quite some time because of their natural resources extraction industry.  C'thulu help them if they tax all the fossil fuels they produce, though.\n\n&gt;there's almost 2 GW of rooftop solar installed now (10% of all households), and South Australia has built up a similar amount of wind energy.\n\nSure.  That's due to a very generous subsidy.  It's a good thing they are enjoying the wealth obtained from exploiting their fossil fuel resource or they wouldn't be able to subsidize any of it.\n\n&gt;Now they have to replace the lost capacity in a hurry and that will of course delay their CO2 reduction targets by a few years.\n\nIt won't just delay it.  It will reverse the progress they've made.  They will probably emit more CO2 10 years from now than they ever have.  It will take them a century to get back to where they are today.\n\n&gt;Of course they do, it will just be achieved more slowly.\n\nRenewables siting follows the same \"pick the low-hanging fruit first\" concept that fossil fuel extraction follows.  There is a law of diminishing returns associated with deployment of renewables, and they won't be able to keep it growing at the same pace they have over the last decade, especially now that they are [cutting solar subsidies](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/02/germany-cuts-solar-power-subsidies).\n\n&gt;We've been through this with the UK as example as well and we concluded that the main reason for why they pay so much more for energy and heating these days is the large increase in European gas prices.\n\nI don't recall that conversation.

Additionally, my other thought here was depending on the location(s) available to park, perhaps this could cut out the unpleasant part(s) of their morning/evening commute. Additionally, maybe there is a distinction between come get my car and take me home in your tier pricing. \n\nI would advise *against* using a concept like Uber/Lyft to pickup/drop off customers’ cars, but I might *encourage* a concept like that for taking people home or picking them up in the morning. Those drivers would have known locations to frequent for fares. The fares should be guaranteed via the memberships/service fee. Versus dramatically fluctuating prices depending on all of the nuances of driving for Uber/Lyft. \n\nI think your problem will be scale. How do you provide a value proposition for both customers and potential employees/drivers/contractors?  If you don’t provide value for both, it will be a nightmare. For example, not enough pay to attract drivers, will result in long wait times to get people home/may not get cars to the desired charge level if the customer’s vehicle doesn’t have enough time to charge - or worse not enough drivers to go get the car and charge it and the customer wakes up with a low state of charge. Conversely, as an example for the customer, if the price of electricity, or membership is too high, they won’t join/use the service. \n\nPersonally, I think you should charge your cost for electricity, and by all means bill them for it, but your money should come from the service of guaranteeing their car stays charged when they need it without them having to think about it. \n\nAfter I made my comment last night, I had another idea. What if your central locations had solar roofs and battery storage. Imagine if you could take sunlight DC to DC storage, then DC storage to charge the car with DC. It doesn’t have to be crazy fast, maybe 10-15 KW for that all night charge. This would minimize power loss during conversion. \n\nBut, then I was thinking you’d need at least 100 kWh of storage per customer, and unless you had a massive solar array, no way you would refill your batteries daily. Then this would complicate where you could locate your parking areas because you couldn’t be in a tall building’s shadow all day. Which made me wonder, could you maybe leverage the solar production during the day. \n\nSo, you flip the script. Instead of worrying about getting people’s cars from their homes, they come to you, you instead help them get to work. How many commuters pay how much to park? Could you offer this service at connection points to large public transportation networks? And if you are charging their car during the day, you could leverage solar to keep your energy costs down.

Let me tell you about my experience and why I think (less than a month in) it might have been a mistake.  \n\n\n**Reason for considering solar**: bought an old house (1870s in MA), big and extremely inefficient in terms of heating. Whether that's on us or not is a good argument, but I vividly remember the crazy housing market in the late 2020s and I'm glad to be able to secure one with less than 3% of interest rate. Sorry, I digressed.   \n\n\nHeating is forced boiled water, which for us makes the gas bill &gt; $600 per month. So a no brainer going solar now that we installed mini splits for cooling in the summer and pick some of the heating load in the winter. The net-metering here in MA is 1:1, so whatever we don't use during the summer, we can pick it up in winter. \n\n**Reason for leasing and not buying outright**: money. We just took a mortgage loan and an additional one for renovations. Solar was not on budget. \n\n* To your first and third point: Sunrun will match your expected electricity usage and bill so it makes sense. \n* To your second point: it will, a couple of percentage points per year. Definitively way less than cost of utility. \n\nSo far, good. Installation and inspection was quick and painless. Sunrun is relentless to close the business. Now, here are a couple of questions you need to ask and make sure to get in writing:\n\n* Production is determined (aside from seasons, weather, etc.) by the number of panels and size of the inverter. Make sure they specify the size of the inverter. In writing. \n* Proactive monitoring, let me tell you what it means and doesn't mean:\n   * It means: You get an app, which you can track production with a couple of hours of delay (normally). If there's a communication problem with the inverter, the inverter will not produce energy and neither you or Sunrun will notice until your electricity bill arrives. UNLESS you actively monitor the status LED of the inverter or install a smart power meter (which is what I did).\n   * It does not mean: if there is a problem, you will get notified right away. \n\nMy system was installed with a defective communication unit and found out the true meaning of proactive monitoring the hard way. Lesson learned I guess.\n\nI bet you can get in touch with your sales rep, that will not be the case with customer support. It took 3 chat sessions, more than 5 calls and a Twitter DM to get someone over to confirm the comms unit was faulty. Mind you, this is a brand new installation. This is my situation until we have the means to buy the system outright. \n\nMy recommendation: if you have the capacity, buy the system. If not, you are trading a known devil (the utility) for an unknown one. And get multiple quotes from different vendors. \n\nOther than that, happy to see the net metering go the other way.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "against particular type/provider but pro solar", "1.2.1_descriptive": "1", "1.2.2_injunctive": "1", "1.3.1_reference_group": "other reddit user", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "pushing for", "1.3.2_mechanism": "other", "1.3.3_second_order": "2"}}, {"comment_index": 363, "comment": "Well, that's where China is going to step in. \n\nMuch like solar panels, they're going to flood the market with batteries.

You don't need to know everything but having some expectations of what your roof is capable of is important just in case an installer is trying to pull one over on you. Some suppliers of solar offer free modeling sotware on their website, like Ironridge. You can play around with different standard modules (try canadian Solar 300 as a startoff if your aren't sure what module will be installed). This will give you a visual in the size and shape required on a rooftop system. It will also tell you the roundabout number of modules you can fit and that in turn will tell you the inverter you would need (multiply number of mods by the wattage of each). This is important because some installers will oversell you on inverters and you won't actually need something that big.\n\nSecond: Is it worthwhile? I am from Tennessee, where selling solar power to the utility is not worth it, because the utility provided power is a) cheap and b) the amount they pay you per watt is less than what you pay them per watt (you actually get a second meter to count them separately). PA allows for Net metering which means the meter goes this way -&gt; when you use power and &lt;- when you push power back to the grid. It also means you get to use the power you make throughout the day (in TN it is usually \"sell all or use all\").\n\nSome paid-for modeling software like helioscope will model shade and give more exact numbers, but if you have a clear roof with no shading then you should be fine using free modeling online. In theory with an unshaded roof you will have full sun from 9am to 3pm. Honestly most roofs we installed had 12-20 modules, which can range you from \\~3000-8000watts (a.k.a. 3-5 kW) of power coming from your solar, depending on module. Assuming at least 6 good hours of sun a day (9am-3pm) gives you about 20000-50000 Watt-hours or 20-50kwh per day. Average electricity for residential in PA is 14 cents per kwh. So theoretically you could offset 2.6 to 6.5 dollars a day, every day it is sunny. \n\nMost solar takes years to completely pay off, but there is something to be said about lowering that monthly bill. Another thing to consider of course is maintenance. Module surfaces will \"soil\" over time (sounds scarier than it is), so cleaning will help them sparkle and keep them at full power. Warranties are pretty good for most equipment providers, but just like any other electrical system it is important to remember that wiring/fuses/panels can fail and need to be replaced over the life of the system.

And the plants under the panels hold on to that water, creating a micro-climate that reduces temperatures under the panels. These reduced temperatures in turn increase the amount of electricity produced by the panels, and slow panel degradation as well!! So the plants ARE contributing to increased electrical generation, and the panels are contributing to increased crop yields!\n\nOf course, you cannot cover a field entirely with solar panels, because plants do need SOME light. But most of the research shows that a field is able to produce 80% of the electricity of a traditional solar field, while simultaneously producing 80% of the crop.

I would consider spending a little extra for the full 200amp backup, at least for the house load. That way you are not relying on a sub panel with emergency loads - set it and forget it. With the Sol-Ark / EG4 inverters you have the choice for net metering if this becomes an option for you later. For my house loads, I installed the Sol-Ark 15k in combination with the indoor EG4 wall mount battery (14.3kwh). I left enough space on the wall in case I want to expand battery storage later. I have an older installation with AP Systems Micro Inverters that feed into the shop / garage side. Here are some rough costs if you do everything DIY.\n\n- 17kW of solar panels at 30cents/watt: $5100\n\n- Sol-Ark 15k Inverter: $7000\n\n- EG4 Wall Mount Battery: $3400\n\n- Tigo TS4-A-O Optimizers / Rapid Shutdown: $2500\n\n- Racking / roof mount materials: $3000\n\n- PV Combiner Box (option): $350\n\n- Wiring / electrical parts: $1500\n\n- Inspection / Permit: $500\n\n  \nSo this is not a $10k installation - it is almost 2.5 that much. Keep in mind that all of these parts are eligible for the 30% tax credit, which will bring the cost down around $16k. I am paying $5000 per year for power to my utility company and should be amortized in 4-5 years - so this installation made sense for me. My local rate is $0.18 / kWh. Installers in my area are quoting between $2.50 and $3.50 per watt installed but without battery backup and no whole house backup. This is over $50k for much less functionality.

Yes, it is true that so-called GHGs are instrumental in maintaining warmth in the lower atmosphere...to a degree. For all sorts of reasons due to complex interactions and exchanges between radiation and gases, warmth can only be trapped to a finite degree and the addition of more GHGs will just cause the same level of IR saturation earlier and lower in the atmosphere without any noticeable effect elsewhere. But without GHGs we would all be dead, no doubt about it.\n\nHowever, I think you do misunderstand some principles. The Sun does not warm the atmosphere to any significant degree (except in some specific cases). UV is absorbed by the ground, the molecules of solid substances absorb UV, get excited, bump into each other and cause heat, thus emitting a very broad spectrum including visible light and IR. That IR is then absorbed by certain gasses which get excited and bump into each other, causing heat and thus emitting IR, but IR at much longer wavelengths that cannot be re-absorbed by the same gas...but can be re-absorbed causing further heat by other gasses - primarily water vapour. But we are talking -50 to -100+ degrees C.\n\nConvection is so ridiculously complex, one cannot simply say that heat is transported or lost because of it. Neither does warming necessarily lead to convection. An example is a standard European 'heat wave'. The reason for the heat wave is there is no convection. Also, the atmosphere is subject to lapse rates depending on density and humidity, so a parcel of air will cool as it rises and warm as it descends. How far it rises depends on the adiabatic lapse rate vs the environmental lapse rate. Warm moist air is generally the most unstable and in a low-pressure area can convect all the way to the tropopause. The height of the tropopause is also highly variable which affects everything else!!! If the sea level temperature is high enough this could lead to a hurricane. But most convection needs a trigger such as being lofted by terrain or passing over a city. In the case of tropical storms moisture-laden air passes over particularly warm ocean regions. Indeed it is descending air that causes a lot of regional warming, for example, look up the Ferhn Effect to understand the mechanism. It is next to impossible to find any reliable information about this on the web but to understand the very basics of this you need to understand the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, the Hadley Cells, Ferrel Cells and the Polar Cells and how they all interact. If you understand this then you would soon realise that European heatwaves are just as likely in a cooling world as a warming one (more likely perhaps?).\n\nThen there is the effect in the sub-tropics (the interaction between the Hadley and Ferrel cells). This is a predominantly high-pressure dust-laden and primarily arid area of the world. The concentrations of dust in the lower atmosphere are so great in some areas that a significant amount of UV is converted to IR before getting to the ground causing warming directly in the atmosphere. I noticed this during my time in the Middle East as I did not need to use sunblock and sunlight was significantly attenuated despite temperatures in the 40s (deg C). Indeed, the attenuation and dust is so significant that solar panels are ridiculously inefficient. I believe at one time it took more energy to clean them than they could harvest!\n\nIn short, it is obvious that CO2 traps heat, but only to a degree. It is also obvious that there is no experimental evidence (other than using computer simulations) that back up any claims made by the theoreticians. We are clearly not seeing any felt changes in the climate compared to the past and we do not have sufficient quality data that goes back far enough to know that anything significant is changing. So...big picture...I agree with you.\n\nIf you want a recent example of where experts are so convinced they are correct that they will denounce anybody who dares to contradict them, look up the fallout from the Monty Hall Problem in probability. The world's best mathematicians all were wrong (maybe not all, but the vast majority) and that was a simple problem that you can work out with your fingers.

But it does NOT seem to derate that system over time to give a truer picture.  So while in year 1 a battery MIGHT offset 90% of my grid import costs, by year 12 it would clearly be less useful (e.g. a FranklinWH aPower battery is warranted to retain only 70% of it's capacity after year 12). What becomes of the battery after that? Gotta replace/recycle it.?   \n\n\nSo one number that becomes important is the number of charge cycles. I've modeled 360 charge cycles per year and given numbers from EnPhase and FranklinWH, that amounts to 0.0009% capacity loss per cycle, or 3.2% per year.  I used that number (360) because the system ostensibly is meant to reduce my grid fraction to zero (otherwise I'm not really avoiding paying for the electricity!).  \n\n\nAnother problem, of course is the seasonality of the sunshine.  We currently have natural gas to heat in our mild winters and expensive-as-heck AC to cool in our sometimes brutal summers.  The good news is if properly sized, the largest energy consumption (the central AC) would be offset by solar MOST of the time.  But if we had resistive heat, we'd be trying to use the solar panels when there are many fewer hours of sunshine - and often many more cloudy days.  \n\n\nSource: [https://www.franklinwh.com/document/Franklin-Home-Power-FHP-Limited-Warranty-for-End-Users-EN](https://www.franklinwh.com/document/Franklin-Home-Power-FHP-Limited-Warranty-for-End-Users-EN)  \n\n\nFinally, there is that \"grid import fraction\" to be considered. Again, one of the tools that was used to provide me an estimate showed my grid-import fraction to be 3% in the summer but up to 56% in the winter (with an unknown allowance for weather variations).  The Import fraction, of course will differ by season and household usage patterns.  E.g. there are very few days we brew some coffee AFTER the sun has already risen. But that import fraction helps to determine how much a solar system has actually offset...

Not because of the pricing but because of the confusion and uncertainty these policies cause for people exactly like you. Just want to say this upfront before raising the following points for you to consider as you continue to explore the possibilities of rooftop solar for your home:\n\n- Something doesn't add up: elsewhere in your comments you state that you spend $300-$400/month (implied $3,600-$4,800/year) on power, yet the benchmark for your savings expectation is implicitly $500s-$600s/month (\"$7-8000/year\"). How would the savings exceed the costs? Even if you had full retail rate net metering available to you, this would not add up.\n- Net metering is available to you: Duke Energy in Indiana does allow you to interconnect and sell excess power back to the grid (net metering). Being paid the full retail rate back for that power (net billing at full retail rate) is what is not available anymore. Instead, payment is based on the wholesale market rate of the exported energy at the time of export, the same economics that all sellers of power to the grid are faced with. This is likely undervalued, but it is available.\n- There *is* a legal standard that makes power companies work with solar installers: it's a federal law called the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA). Mostly this law is useful to large power plants such as solar farms, but it applies to all small and renewable power generators. It's a significant gray area, but this is why utilities haven't completely removed net metering and are simply making it more and more resemble the wholesale market: if they did not interconnect or compensate these power sources at all, they could be compelled to do so.\n- You can install solar without any permission from your local grid operator: a system with zero backfeed to the grid \nshould need only local government construction permitting and possibly a notice to the local grid operator that the system is there in case of emergency. A system like this makes sense only with a lot of storage and is less economically efficient than a good net metered system, but if Duke were truly not allowing rooftop systems to interconnect then this would be the way.\n- Consider storage, regardless: with the low export compensation based on time-of-day market prices, storing and using as much energy as possible on-site becomes very important. Also, with most storage installations you will gain the resilience benefit of having power when the grid goes down.\n- Talk to more installers or, better yet, an energy agent or electrician: it sounds like the installers you have spoken to haven't figured out the new local economics for your area yet or there is some other factor they are oversimplifying (e.g. sometimes there are limits to how much net metered solar can be interconnected per neighborhood/circuit before significant upgrades are required, meaning installations are essentially stalled for those addresses). Five is the minimum number of quotes we like to solicit, and we are very specific about asking only for the technical potential rather than letting installers try to tell our members what is financially possible for them.\n- Consider community solar: if you want to achieve the environmental benefit of \"going solar\" while saving a bit, consider connecting to a local solar farm while you figure all of this out. It's a lot simpler (literally a digital process that takes a minute), and can get you on the right track toward solarizing your home while eliminating your carbon footprint immediately. It's also a helpful negotiating point with installers because they aren't selling you an environmental benefit anymore, just a financial one.\n- Consider electrifying your home: this will make a big difference to the amount of solar and savings you can sustain. Any methane (heating, cooking) or petroleum (transportation) appliances in your home could be savings if electrified, and doing this *before* a rooftop solar installation will increase the size of the system your home can support.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "1", "1.1.1_stance": "pushing for", "1.2.1_descriptive": "2", "1.2.2_injunctive": "2", "1.3.1_reference_group": "people like me", "1.3.1b_perceived_reference_stance": "against", "1.3.2_mechanism": "other", "1.3.3_second_order": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 555, "comment": "2 Quotes from Sunrun and HarvestPower(Local Company).

For example a panel would be labelled 300W but that is with 1000w/m2 of direct sunlight, at 25C temp. Outside of those conditions the wattage varies.\n\n Now on to the next part. You said you wanted 6000kWh per year in solar energy production, then you would like to know how many panels that equates to. Here is how that is calculated: \n\nTotal Production goal (6000kWh) ÷ Days in the year (365)= Daily production goal (16.44kWh) \nDaily production ÷ Average hours of sunlight at array site (let's say 6) = Hourly Production (2.74kW)\n\nNow this says you would need to product 2.74kW for 6 hrs to produce enough solar power to reach 6000kWh at the end of the year.\nSo, now we size the array to product around 16.44 kWh per day. \n\nLet's use 300W panels. \n2.74kW x 1000= 2740W ÷ 300W = 9.1 Panels \nThis says we need 9.1 panels performing perfectly to produce enough power. (Size up to 10)\n\nSo, now you derate for lost of power at your site, this is where it gets trickier.\nYou need to account for things like angle or tilt of solar panels to the sun, the direction, any shading that might hit the panels at some point in the day. Along with location, temperature, and local weather.\n\nThat being said, here in Seattle I assume I can get 2 - 3  times the array size per day in kWh. So 6kW array produces 18kWh per day. Which is about what you would need to reach 6000kWh/year here.\n\nSo you would need 20 x 300W panels on your array to hit your goals if you were located in Seattle.\nHope that helps, let me know if you have any questions about any of this.\n", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 563, "comment": "How easy to add battery after solar panels installed?

But hopefully it will be much cheaper to build it myself. \n\nThe whole build must be compact enough to store most of it (apart from the solar panels) in a stow-n-go floor compartment (roughly 4 cubic feet). I would store the solar panels somewhere else in the van. \n\nI’d probably be able to have the solar panels outside working for several hours a day almost every day. \n\nIt would be GREAT if I could also charge the battery with a 12v car adapter while driving. \n\nI figure I would need about 4 AC outlets.\n\nHere’s a list of the devices/appliances that it would need to power:\n\n1) an electric cooler will probably be running off it almost full-time. Something like a Dometic brand cooler or something cheaper. \n\n2) a laptop/MacBook will probably need a full charge off of it approximately once a day. \n\n3) a Nintendo Switch will probably need a full charge off of it approximately once a day. \n\n4) a couple smartphones and a couple e-readers may need to charge off it approximately 2-3 times a week. \n\nI’ve watched a couple videos to try and gain some knowledge.

Not sure what kind to get or where to get it. \n\nI’ve learned that I’ll also need a charge controller. But I don’t know what kind and where to find it?\n\nAnd I guess if I want to be able to charge it with a 12v car adapter I’ll need something for that... but I don’t know what. \n\nAnd I also don’t know what kinds of wires and cables I’ll need to connect all this stuff together. \n\nSo sorry for the lengthy post.

The problem was with the inflation rider, my monthly lease cost would double over the life of the lease.  I went with a solar loan two years ago and got solar installed on my house.  My monthly loan payment is a bit higher than if I leased, however, over the 20 year life of the loan, my payments remain the same.  Currently, the monthly loan cost is lower than what I save on my electric bill, so I am getting a net positive savings.  As the years go by and electric costs go up, my savings will increase.  I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket, the loan covered everything.  Since the panels are mine, I got the solar tax credit, which I promptly had to pay to the loan company to pay down the loan.\n\nBack when I was looking at a solar lease, the proposal was to install a 10 kW system.  The lease payment would have been $180 a month to start, and would grow to over $330 a month by the end of the lease.

Granted the cost of solar has gone down significantly from the time I looked into solar leases and the time I bought my system. \n\nFWIW, my electric utility does not own any generating plants, so it purchases all of their electricity on the open market.

Where the growth in the electric bill really comes from is the delivery charge (the cost of bringing the electricity to my home, which covers the cost of grid maintenance and labor).

And, 90% of that is from the more affluent half of the world population who live in the developed countries.  Simple math then suggests that \"we\" are realistically the ones to blame.  It can be pointed out that the very rich are responsible for a large portion of that, and it is true. But, that still leaves enough of the blame on the shoulders of the rest of us, that \"we\" can and need to make a difference in our own lives.  Those of us who are in this group are people who care. Carrying only really counts when it is followed by effective actions. This does not mean that it is enough to recycle your plastics, and compost your excess food waste, before you drive your fossil fuel SUV to the airport for a couple of day in the Caribbean, with your gas heat at home left on 72°.  It means at least making plans for some major changes.\n\nThe first step is easy. Where is your electric coming from?  Most utilities have some sort of option for green electricity. In many areas community solar farms are being built. This greening of your electricity will cost little or nothing, and in some places actually saves you money compared to staying with dirty fossil fuel and nuclear electricity.   Prepare for when your air conditioner needs replacing. DO NOT replace it with one that just cools and does not also have the ability to work as an efficient \"Heat Pump\". A heat pump is an air conditioner that you can very efficiently heat your house, with using your green renewable electricity supply.  Make equivalent plans for when you need to replace your water heater with a \"Heat Pump Water Heater\", which Energy Star says will do the job for half the cost of an equivalent gas water heater.  We have one, in a cold climate, and our water heating cost is negligible.  Fossil fuel water heaters typically only last 8-12 years, so on average yours is likely to need replacing in only 4-6 years from now.  Be ready.. so that you know what to do, and can avoid locking yourself into another 8-12 years of burning fossil fuels.  The same applies to your furnace, which is likely to need replacing or expensive repair in the next ten years. Especially if you have already replaced your AC with a heat pump, you can switch your house the rest of the way to all efficient heat pumps, a lot easier and more economically. We heat our who 1220sqft, 100 year old house in a cold/very cold climate, with just one small 12,000BTU mini-split heat pumps, and have a couple of plug in electric heaters, and a small glass front wood burner as backup, for the rare few hours of the heating season when our small mini-split is not enough. We are doing some remodeling that we expect will also significantly improve our energy efficiency. Always upgrade when it is most cost-effective.\n\nElectrifying your kitchen can be a lot easier than you might think.  We bought a couple of portable induction hob/burners to see if we liked induction cooking. In hindsight the idea of not liking it now seems absurd. But, it was a good move because we also discovered that we really liked the portable hobs, that just plug into a stand wall outlet, and can be moved around to virtually anywhere we want to be able to cook or heat something. And, they are so efficient and fast that the second one generally stays in the drawer. We also use an Insta-Pot that does a lot of things better than cooking over an inefficient gas stove.  And they also don't fill your kitchen and your lungs (and your family's lungs) with methane, deadly carbon-monoxide, nitrogen oxide, etc, like gas cooking does. Our electric wall oven is also wonderful. We bought it at a Habitat For Humanity Restore for literally 1¢ on the dollar. We also have a countertop combination microwave, convection, and air  fryer ($250) for smaller oven cooking. Converting our kitchen from all gas, to all electric was inexpensive, because we planned well, and held economics as a priority.\n\nI fully understand how the idea of changing your home over to green electricity, from fossil fuels, can seem totally overwhelming.  But, like everything else in life it just take familiarizing yourself with the process. When your AC, or furnace, or water heater fails, is not the time to start learning. Being ready, and able to make smart decisions will save your thousands of dollars.  In the US there are 70,000,000 existing homes that will still be here in 2050, when we need ALL of them to have already been converted to all electric.  This may be the most outstanding point in history for you to do something very important and set an example for your friends, family, and neighbors to see how to make this inevitable transition smartly and in time to make a real difference.  Start your personal transition now.  I say this as someone who now uses only green electricity in our home or our car. We live fossil free, and we are very frugal.\n\nAdded - There were a couple of comments to this post, which have been removed for some reason. I would like to address them. One was that my post was \"such a privileged response\"  This is blatantly untrue.  We bought the worst house in a good but modest working class neighborhood, and have been spending all our spare time in the past 8 years bringing it back into being a bright spot in the neighborhood, for both saving/recycling old neglected homes, and also for preparing our existing housing stock to be valid for the next 100 years, when we all must stop burning fossil fuels. We have a long way to go to be finished with this project. We have done \"ALL\" the work ourselves,  with the vast majority of the potentially expensive materials bought recycled via Habitat for Humanity Restores. We are not \"privileged\" unless you consider being willing to work extremely hard to live a good, environmentally and socially conscious life \"\"privileged\".\n\n   As for the comment that \"going vegan would make a greater personal impact\"  That is also far from being true.  To start with, we are already vegetarians, cooking at home from scratch. We even buy short dated vegies whenever possible. And, we very very seldom ever eat away from home, with the large carbon footprint of restaurants.  However, in general all of us need to change. \"Going vegan\" can be a small step in the right direction, as long as it is not used as an excuse to ignore (and even try to discredit) everything else that we must all do to stop damaging our world climates. This is the end of the Fossil Fuel Era, and the beginning of the Solar Age. We all have to make the decision to act in time to make a difference, or make excuses that help us live in denial. What I am saying is that this change (to renewable electricity) is happening NOW, and planning for it, and replacing your fossil fuel burning machines as they need replacing or significant repairs, will make the transition far less expensive and stressful.

They can be installed on the roof or on the ground, depending on available space and sunlight exposure. During normal operation, the electricity produced by the solar panels can be used to power your home or fed back to the grid for credits (net metering). During a power outage, solar panels cannot provide power on their own unless paired with batteries.\r  \n\r  \nBattery Storage: Batteries are an important part of a solar/battery backup system. They store excess electricity generated by solar panels during the day for use at night or when there is no sunlight. During an outage, the energy stored in the battery can power the entire house or selected critical loads, depending on the capacity of the battery system.\r  \n\r  \nEnergy Management System: An energy management system controls the flow of electricity between solar panels, battery storage, and the electrical loads in your home. It ensures that power is utilized efficiently and critical loads are prioritized during outages.\r  \n\r  \nAdvantages: Solar/battery systems offer several advantages over traditional backup generators. They provide clean and renewable energy, reduce reliance on the grid, and can save on utility bills by harnessing stored solar energy. Additionally, they run quietly and require less maintenance than fossil fuel generators.\r  \n\r  \nThings to note: When considering a solar/battery system for whole-house backup power, factors such as system size, battery capacity, and required backup duration need to be considered. Professional installation and correct system sizing are critical for optimal performance and safety. It’s important to consult with a reputable solar installer or energy professional who can assess your specific needs and provide tailored advice.\r  \n\r  \nWhile a solar/battery system for whole-house backup power can be a reliable and sustainable solution, it's critical to evaluate your energy needs, budget, and available resources before making a decision.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 601, "comment": "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-15/world-energy-hits-a-turning-point-solar-that-s-cheaper-than-wind) reduced by 86%.

Solar by it's very nature is unpredictable and battery storage will be more needed to stabalize fluctuations.\n\nSo yeah, the ability to transfer power between states in the United States, including from California, depends on the existing interconnections and agreements within the regional electric grid. California is part of the Western Interconnection, which is one of the major interconnections in the U.S. electric grid.\n\nInterstate power transfers are typically facilitated through regional transmission organizations (RTOs) or independent system operators (ISOs) that manage the grid within a specific region. In the case of the Western Interconnection, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) manages the transmission of electricity within California, and the grid is interconnected with other utilities and grid operators in the region.\n\nIf there is a situation where a neighboring state needs additional power or is facing a shortage, it's possible for electricity to be transmitted from California, depending on the capacity and agreements in place. However, the feasibility of such transfers is subject to the availability of transmission capacity, regulatory approvals, and contractual arrangements between the involved entities.\n\nIt's important to note that the electric grid is a complex system, and decisions regarding power transfers are made based on various factors, including grid reliability, operational considerations, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, these dynamics can change over time as grid infrastructure is upgraded, and new agreements are established.\n\nSo California has the ability to export excess solar power to other states through the interconnected electric grid.  However, it's essential to consider the limitations and challenges associated with large-scale interstate power transfers, such as transmission capacity constraints, regulatory approvals, and the need for a well-coordinated grid management system.\n\nThe extent to which this occurs can depend on various factors, including the time of day, seasonal variations, grid conditions, and the overall demand and supply dynamics within the Western Interconnection.", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 638, "comment": "As of April 2023, Lazard LCOE reports started to include firming costs.

Everything was done virtually until we got to a point where a personal visit was required.\n\nI took pictures of my electrical panel and other relevant things, emailed them to a representative for evaluation, so they knew ahead of time exactly what I had. And they didn’t come out earlier because they didn’t need to.\n\nThey handled all the permitting with the City Hall, and everything was completely professional.\n\nInstallation day arrived and I could not have been more impressed. There were six men for the job arriving in two vehicles and they were waiting for about a half an hour for the truck carrying equipment to arrive. Once that happened, it was like poetry in motion.\n\nTwo trained and skilled electricians worked at my current panel and installed a new replacement panel. They also installed the battery pack and the inverter, and they connected everything together on the electrical side.\n\nMeanwhile, four men were up on the roof with the solar panels installing everything. I purchased a 7.2 kW system with I believe 18 panels so it was not a small system at all, and it was installed on three different roof surfaces, yet they were finished by a little after noon.\n\nThe installers left, and the electricians remained to connect everything and get it all functioning and operational.  If memory serves me correctly, the electricians left at about 4:30 in the afternoon.\n\nEverything was completed in one day from start to finish. I did have the permits already granted, and I did have all of the approvals that were necessary, but my house was completely untouched until the day that they arrived.\n\nI couldn’t have been happier with the very professional way that everything was handled from beginning to end, but then I had to start using my system and find out how it was going to affect my life in the real world. \n\nI didn’t get my final permission to operate from  the local Edison company until December, so until actually the second half of the month of December I was unable to sell power back. I could generate power for my own needs during the day, and charge my Powerwall, but if there was any excess production after my battery was fully charged, it would not be used or would not benefit me in any way. \n\nOnce permission to operate was granted, I was finally able to start selling back excess production.\n\nAs of my June bill, my total energy cost for the entire year was $44!\n\nDon’t forget that my payment for the equipment is not included in that, but the main thing is that I am breaking almost exactly even with what I was paying directly to the Edison company prior to getting the solar equipment.  Of course at some point, I will own the system, and the loan payment will go away.\n\nThe $44 YTD reflects the massive savings that the solar equipment has provided me.\n\nI really like the fact that I was dealing with one company and one product line. Other solar companies have to buy batteries from one manufacturer, panels from another, and inverters from a third, while a fourth company would be putting it all together into a cohesive system. \n\nI am what some people might call “living the dream”, since I also have an electric car. That $44 total energy consumption for the year from Edison also includes my “gasoline”, because of solar panels power my car as well.\n\nI would have to give Tesla a 10 if such a rating were available to me. I simply have nothing negative to say about the entire experience. They called when they said they were going to call, they came out and did the job in an extremely professional manner, and it’s been functioning properly and exquisitely ever since, so I honestly don’t know what I could say in any sense negative about them.\n\nI highly recommend Tesla to anyone considering solar. I did a lot of homework before I made the ultimate decision to go with them, and I am very glad I did.\n\nI will be fair about my review and say that this is the only solar system that I have experience with. I don’t know if other companies do as good a job as Tesla did. Maybe they do.

A lot of repairs can be performed immediately if it is physical damage such as modules breaking or equipment being damaged but restoring power to a lot of these plants is dependent on the utility restoring power on their side first. When storms hit response times are slower just due to the high demand for utility support when lines are down and the damage is extensive. Being prepared for these situations is how they keep up. If they aren’t prepared then they are looking at long down times.  Residential companies do provide support too and I am sure their backlogs get pretty big when the areas they operate in see extreme weather events and damages.

[This article plus helpful graph](https://phys.org/news/2017-07-effective-individual-tackle-climate-discussed.html) explains what the more impactful things are. I was super pissed off after spending years worrying about rain barrels, taking shorter showers, and being careful to turn off the faucet while brushing only to find that these steps 100% ignore [the \"elephant in the room\" that corporations are hoping we don't notice](https://www.truthordrought.com/water). I have still kept my old water-saving habits, but pressuring the government to support and companies to supply more water-friendly products is far more impactful than our little habits in the kitchen, bathroom, or garden.\n\nI've been working with the other mods of r/PlaneteerHandbook, to put together some helpful guidelines about Levels of Activism, and Types of Activism (not posted yet, sorry!) to help my fellow environmentalists pick and choose the more impactful actions that will fit their life situations/skills/passions. I firmly believe that one size doesn't fil all because we all live in different places with access to different things, which I'm going to use as an example to touch on Levels of Activism and why that's important to your question here.\n\nHistorically we've been told to focus on Levels 1 and 4. If we look at Level 1 Activism as personal action, and Level 4 Activism as what governments and multinational corporations are doing, or at least our attempts to get them to engage in better behavior then we start to run into problems when nothing get's done at level 2 or 3. For example, in the chart I shared, you can see that using public transportation is a high-impact activity. At level one, if you find there is no local transit system in your area, or going where you need to go, then you just have to pick something else. At level 4, the government can shell out money to create transit systems, but they may not know the best places to put them. Which is why it's important to jump in at Level 3 where you start contacting your local parish/county/city/town/village council to tell them where you and others in your community need to have public transit lines or stops added. Then when they show up, you are finally able to engage in Level 1 AND Level 2 which is where you invite/convince/dare people you know or are related to to join you in using the system. Help them learn where they can buy a ticket or access card, let them know if certain ages or days have cheaper fare, let them know if the transit goes reasonably close to their homes, places or work, hospitals, or fun places like museums.\n\nThe system as it is, as we're told to play the game is kinda broken, and \"the powers that be\" kinda want it that way. They get to keep making money, polluting, and don't have to change their behavior as long as we keep hyper-focusing on tiny personal actions, or the occasional protest to politicians who often don't know what to do themselves. By joining existing environmental organizations, by increasing pressure on local, high-impact changes, we create a patchwork quilt of the cleaner, safer, better world we want to live in. Focusing on improving our own communities makes us stronger, helps educate us, connects us to others who also want to make a difference, and provides a safety new during times of disaster. Companies profit from people feeling alone, nervous, and vulnerable, which I suspect is why they want us to focus on personal action instead of coming together to create a healthier, stronger movement.\n\nI created this collection of [Action Maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/ubw7et/action_maps/) so people can more easily see where actions are being taken around them (maybe even choose to join in!), a directory of [Helpful Subs for Planeteers](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/fn634x/helpful_subreddits_for_planeteers/) (organized by topic so you can find what speaks to you), and a [Directory of Organizations to Volunteer with](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/felww8/directory_of_organizations_to_volunteer_with/) (or support). One of our other mods posted [this great resource about how to successfully communicate with government leaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/tyqh9k/how_to_contact_your_representatives_master_thread/) (the comments section has a growing list of addresses/politician finders to make contacting them easier). My suggestion is to focus on finding the Level 1 Actions you can and want to participate in, then if any turn out to be \"too hard\" or \"impossible\" in your geographic region, then take those as signals that they may need some level 2-4 intervention. Try to work out what's missing so that you and other environmentalists you know can focus your efforts on \"removing barriers to action\" for yourselves and others in your community. \n\nFor example, pressuring for better transit, reviewing restaurants or groceries or talking to their customer service about adding more planet-friendly alternatives (eco-friendly/returnable packaging, or plant-based alternatives for things they already serve), maybe fund raise to get solar power for the local schools, hospitals, and retirement homes, so the people in them are less likely to die from temperature extremes in times of disaster. Maybe you have bad heatwaves, traffic congestion, air pollution, public health, and lack of connectivity, so it would be worth getting together with community planners to create a safer network of walking/cycling paths, parks and tree-cover to help connect residents with one another, local businesses, health services, etc. while giving them a healthy alternative to driving. Try to focus on one problem and solution at a time, see if an organization is already working on the problem, or talk with people you know to see if you can create a little team.

They seem to have templated the same document, which makes me think there is some consortium they share. I found this explanation from a nearby city.\n\n&gt;As a public power utility, the City of Bowling Green operates a not-for-profit electric utility. Most of the Utilities Department's expenses are fixed costs, meaning the expenses don't change much based on a customer's usage. The City's electric rates are based on a Cost of Service Study that examines all of the expenses to provide the electrical needs of our community. The expenses include, but are not limited to, power supply contracts, transmission and capacity obligations, the cost of infrastructure such as electric poles, lines, and transformers, and finally, the cost to ensure our staff and equipment are available and equipped to respond to electrical issues anywhere in the city at a moment's notice, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The rates that are charged to customers are designed for full-service requirement customers (a customer that purchases all of their energy needs from the City). In this way, the City ensures that our expenses are equitably collected from each customer based on their use of the electric system. The Cost of Service Study is the best way to ensure that the customer charges are fair and equitable.  \nWhen a customer installs rooftop solar, they become a partial-service requirement customer. This means that the customer does not purchase all of their energy needs from the City because they are offsetting some or all of their energy needs with their own generating system. The customer relies on the City to provide all of their electric service at any given time but they do not pay the same costs as a full-service requirement customer. The customer also depends upon the City's electric distribution system in order to receive a credit for their excess generation.  \nThe Monthly Facilities Charge is necessary to recover the unavoidable fixed expenses mentioned above that are incurred by the City. Again, these costs include system maintenance, transformers, debt service, capital improvements, power supply, transmission, capacity, buildings, equipment, and labor. Without this additional charge, non-generating customers subsidize the electric service for generating customers. Details about the Facilities Charge can be found in Rider E  \nExamples  \nA residential customer installs a 5 kilowatt (kW) customer-owned renewable resource generator in the form of rooftop solar panels. After July 1, 2021, this resident will be charged a Local Facilities Charge of $5 per month ($1 per kW × 5kW). This charge will increase over the next four years, making it easier for current rooftop solar customers to adjust. At full implementation (in year 2024), the rate will be $4 per kW AC and the customer would pay $20 per month for the charge.  \n2021: Example Resident pays $5 per month  \n2022: Example Resident will pay $10 per month  \n2023: Example Resident will pay $15 per month  \n2024: Example Resident will pay $20 per month\n\nOk ...

At the moment, many people are looking ahead to the Paris talks this coming December because the outcome of that event has potential to change the course of climate action significantly. So after that, there should be more information to go on.\n\nBut in terms of climate change becoming \"undeniable\" to a majority of people, I personally don't see that happening. The reality and dangers of climate change *should* be undeniable to everyone already, but research shows that climate denialist viewpoints aren't swayed by evidence, data, or facts. In fact, presenting them with facts often makes them believe their original viewpoints even more strongly due to the kickback effect. However, I have hope that a certain number of people who are on the fence or simply don't know much about climate change will soon begin to realize the dangers, simply due to wider and more frequent media coverage.\n\nIt also helps, I think, that we're starting to have more specific studies on the influence of climate change when it comes to individual weather events. A few years ago, people would ask \"was this hurricane caused by climate change?\" And the only valid scientific answer was \"we don't know. Climate change increases the number of hurricanes over time and increases the damage those hurricanes can do, but we can't say if this particular one was caused by climate change.\"\n\nNow though, due to more advanced models and better data/technology, we're often able to say \"this tornado/hurricane/drought was 83% more likely to happen due to the effects of climate change.\" Being able to link in people's minds those individual, very visceral, very real, widely covered events to climate change is huge in my opinion. So in that sense, I think a stronger majority of people will start to understand and hopefully act, but I doubt we'll ever have a vast majority. People are too rooted in their own personal experience. If they don't see it immediately in their direct surroundings, they'll continue to just shrug it off.\n\nAs for energy distribution (in the US, I'm not as familiar with foreign situations), I think that will depend largely on A) technological advances and B) political will. Right now, there's very little political will to do much on a large scale. Too many politicians heavily funded by the oil industry and too many are climate change deniers. For god's sake, the senate chair of the Energy and Environment committee is one of the most outspoken climate deniers we've seen; he literally believes that climate change can't be real because \"God wouldn't let that happen.\" Obama and the EPA have enacted certain measures which are great, but will only go so far. \n\nSo the real driver, I think, will be technological advances. If we can make solar power that's cheaper to produce and maintain than traditional oil/coal power it'll be huge. Why? Take the staunchest climate denier out there and offer them an energy bill that's lower than their current, and they'll take it. They don't care that it comes from solar panels, they just want to spend less money. The thing here is that it needs to be across so many industries. Imagine if someone could create an efficient, long-range electric powered semi-truck. Suddenly, trucking companies would save fortunes from not having to buy gas. Same thing goes with large-scale industrial power. That's what's so exciting about Tesla: for such a long time, electric cars were silly looking tin cans that could only go 50 miles on a charge. Then Tesla showed us that it is possible to make a car that can drive 200 miles on a charge, reload in a few minutes, look amazingly sexy, and be fast as hell all at the same time. That's incredible. \n\nSo that's a long way of saying I can't really answer your question on a decade by decade basis. There are too many variables at play. But my personal prediction is that technology will continue to accelerate over the next decade while political action stagnates. Within 10-20 years I think we'll see large scale electric use in consumer transportation and solar/wind energy that's cheaper than oil/coal.

New technology and it being cheaper than fossil fuel options is key, and that’s why we need a carbon tax to make them much more competitive.\n\nIf we take a look at GHG emissions across all sectors, consumption is a factor, but a good chunk of our emissions are things that are solved problems, just waiting on rollout. The key to that is going to be govt incentives, carbon tax, and regulation of assorted other things.\n\nThe key things to do will be to pursue the technologies that we haven't solved yet. Get into lab or plant-based meat, sustainable steel and concrete, public transport, direct air capture, the whole shebang.\n\nI digress, while I'm a realist, and recognize that we have a mountain ahead of us, humans have been through hell and back, we're experienced at pulling stunts like this. Not to say we don't have to be freaking out, we do, but being overly pessimistic to the level where it hurts day-to-day life isn't worth it imo, because it makes us who are solving the problem less effective as people, as well as depressed.

Even though our quotes seem kind of crappy the monthly payments would still be about the same if not lower than our average electric bill but we also don't want to sign a contract for a system that costs $50-80,000 and that will generate more energy than we need. I also don't like the interest rates much for any of the companies. We are thinking of paying off the loan much quicker than the loan term after we deal with some other non-related bills this summer. Does that make mathematical sense to do if there is no penalty for paying the loan off early?\n\nThe better insulation and sealing will reduce your energy usage, the heat pump will increase your electricity usage but eliminate your oil usage.  the 13.3kW quote  is probably a good honest one. you should post the details of it for us to review.\n\nDon't get financing through the installer, get it through your bank.  You will save a significant amount of money taking a higher interest loan through your bank and paying it off early.  installers give you those loans with low rates by paying down points like a mortgage. and there is no Truth In Lending act for solar installers.\n\n> Doesn't it make more sense to be installing enough panels to generate enough energy to cover all of our energy usage instead of just covering half and paying the rest to our electric company?

Different solar panel systems may have specific requirements or limitations when it comes to adding batteries, so it's crucial to consult with professionals or the original installer to understand your options.\r  \n\r  \nIn my case, I had a grid-tied solar panel system without batteries initially. To add battery storage, I had to upgrade several components, including the inverter and electrical panels, to accommodate the new battery system. This process involved working with a licensed solar installer and obtaining the necessary permits and approvals from local authorities.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the critical decisions you'll need to make is the type and capacity of the battery system you want to install. There are various battery technologies available, such as lithium-ion, lead-acid, or saltwater batteries, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance, lifespan, and cost. Additionally, you'll need to determine the desired storage capacity based on your energy consumption needs and backup power requirements.\r  \n\r  \nIn my situation, I opted for a lithium-ion battery system with a capacity that could provide backup power for essential loads during outages and allow me to store excess solar energy for use during peak demand hours. This decision was based on my specific energy needs, budget, and the recommendations of the solar installer.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to note that adding battery storage can be a significant investment, and the costs can vary widely depending on the system size, battery technology, and installation requirements. However, in many cases, there are incentives or tax credits available that can help offset some of the upfront costs.\r  \n\r  \nThroughout the process, it's crucial to work with reputable and experienced solar professionals who can guide you through the different options, ensure proper system design and installation, and provide ongoing support and maintenance services.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, consider your long-term goals and the potential for future expansions or upgrades to your solar and battery system. Choosing a modular and scalable solution can make it easier to adapt to changing energy needs or technological advancements in the future.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, adding battery storage to an existing solar panel system can be a complex undertaking, but it can provide numerous benefits, including increased energy independence, backup power during outages, and the ability to maximize the use of your solar-generated electricity.

The construction of on-farm fertilizer manufacturing eliminates all GHG emissions from both the manufacturing and transportation of nitrogen fertilizers. It also offers an opportunity to put the ownership and control over fertilizer production back in the hands of farmers.\n\nThe solar powered process provides a viable, carbon-free alternative to nitrogen fixation methods like the Haber-Bosch process - a process which uses fossil fuel as both feedstock AND the fuel to power the reaction. Our current production of nitrogen fertilizers from fossil fuels directly releases more CO2 than any other human driven chemical process on earth.\n\nOne of the founders of Nitricity claims that the system actually works best when connected to an intermittent power source, and that solar power provides a cheap, reliable, and effective solution.\nThere's a YouTube video of one of the founders answering interview questions that I transcribed around a month ago when I learned about this company. Hopefully copying the transcription can preemptively answer some of your questions &amp; criticisms:\n\nNicolas Pinkowski: \"We've chosen this system because it is low capital cost. So the cost of the pilot is fairly low. The question is where can we get electricity? And if you've got a farm that has low cost electricity, or solar, let's test it out!\"\n\nInterviewer: \"What is the price per pound of elemental fertilizer that you can produce?\"\n\nNicolas Pinkowski: \"Currently, with the smaller system, one you know, put together with Amazon and McMaster Carr parts, we've estimated that our production is somewhere between $3 and $4 per pound of nitrogen. We have to assume a depreciation timeline to do that, but that's our first estimated cost. Which is pretty good! It's about half way between something like calcium nitrate and organic fertilizer. Moving forwards, what we're doing is we're transitioning from using Amazon.com parts, to using a more developed supply chain, which will bring down the costs. And we're also scaling up to a bigger product. By scaling from a 1 acre system to a 25 acre system, we have all the same number of components, all the components are just slightly larger. And accordingly our levelized cost per pound of nitrogen can be decreased, and now is between $1 and $2 per pound of nitrogen. Our first off-take contract is about $1.50 per pound of that\"\n\nInterviewer: \"How do you store off-season and how do you buffer the acid when one already has ph levels in between 6.5 and 7?\"\n\nNicolas Pinkowski: \"Two good questions. Storing is easy. For our 1 acre system, we put a tank right next to it, a 200 gallon tank. And that's essentially a smoothing function between a difference in production rate and use rate. That's a very low cost way to do it and has worked pretty good. Now the 2nd part of that question was, 'now what happens if you already have an ideal ph in your field, and you don't need nitric acid, you'd want a balanced ph'. It's very easy! We take one of the cheapest substances that's already available on farms - lime - and we combine that with the nitric acid.. and then we have irrigable calcium nitrate fertilizer.. which is a high value fertilizer. It's very good, it's very water soluble, and can provide calcium which promotes cell strength and early development in crops. What we can also do and have done for our current farm, is instead of neutralizing or balancing the ph with lime, we balance the ph with a potassium compound, and then we make potassium nitrate. Now if you want to buy potassium nitrate, it's often a little tricky. It's not widely available in CA. It is widely available in some of the south, but there's some emissions associated with shipping concentrated forms of potassium nitrate. We can make potassium nitrate and we can make it for low cost.

Oh, pardon me, $30,000-$35,000 will be for about 50% capacity factor less electricity, so you know, kind of taking advantage of lower cost rates.

That’s where solar shingles come into play. This innovative technology seamlessly merges with your roof, turning sunlight into a sustainable power source for your household.\r  \n\r  \nBut when compared with solar panels, both have their own set of perks to offer. Consequently, it becomes almost impossible to choose one of them before you know which is better for your space. That is exactly what we will try to answer in this complete [solar shingles vs. solar panels guide](https://solarxess.com/blog/solar-shingles-vs-solar-panels/).\r  \n\r  \nSolar shingles and solar panels share the same basic principle. Both absorb sunlight and convert that energy into electrical power for a home or office. The differences lie more in their shape and the location where they are (usually) installed. We have summarized these below.\r  \n\r  \nUnlike traditional rigid solar panels, solar shingles are more flexible, and thinner and offer greater scalability when used in residential areas.\r  \nSolar shingles can be integrated into roofing materials; solar panels lack this feature by always requiring open space at the top of a roof.\r  \n\r  \nDesigned to replace your traditional roofing, solar shingles of course come with inherent weather and dust resistance. Solar panels, on the other hand, are not designed to withstand changing weather conditions. Compared to solar panels, solar shingles have the advantage of being lightweight in comparison while offering long-term durability.\r  \n\r  \nSolar shingles are a hot topic for the 2020s. Being the newest BIPV technology, their thin-filmed versions are heavily researched as futuristic sustainable solar solutions. They benefit from generating consistent power, not only at elevated temperatures but also on cloudy, overcast days and at low sun angles.\r  \n\r  \nThis is the first thing on your mind, right? If you want to estimate the cost of solar shingles, everything boils down to how large your roof is and which brand you are considering. Because, unlike traditional roof shingles, solar roof shingles come with solar cells. Since these cells are responsible for converting sunlight into electricity, they are priced per watt, not per square foot. This cost can be anything between $3.50 to $8.50 per watt, depending on the brand.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, solar panels are priced per panel, or a complete 6kW system. This costs around $6000 to $9000 depending on the type of solar technology and the brand. Doing simple math gives an average price of a solar panel to range from $1 to $1.5 per watt. There are also cheaper alternatives of polycrystalline solar panels for as low as $0.75 per watt.\r  \n\r  \nTherefore, it seems obvious why small homeowners drift towards solar panels as it is cost-effective. But do note that the price of a solar shingle includes the price of roofing materials.

If you are generating 6kWh from your panels, and only using 2kWh, there is no where for the extra 4kWh to go, and 4kWh is too much for the charge rate of the battery, so you get no solar production and your battery just doesn't charge at all.\n\nYour solar inverter cannot limit how much it puts out, it is putting out power or it isn't, it cannot only let 3kWh trickle through if the panels are generating more than that so you can use 2kWh and charge with 1kWh. It's either letting the full 6kWh through, or it is letting 0kWh through. Because your current power usage AND battery charging current combined is less than what your solar is generating, you get zero solar generation.\n\nGo turn all of your oven and stove elements on to crank up your power usage, and you will see your solar kick in. Otherwise, once your batteries go down to about 75% they will charge up some because the battery can charge at a faster rate at a lower level. But as the sun goes down and generation decreases, eventually your solar will kick on once it reaches a point where production is closer to usage.\n\nYou could also theoretically slowly turn on more and more stuff to get your power consumption higher, so that you are using like 5kWh. That would allow the inverter to close, letting 6kWh through, 5kWh powering your consumption, and the other 1kWh charging the battery.\n\nThe other way to avoid this problem is by having your system installed with micro-inverters instead. Each panel then has it's own inverter, so only half of your panels would be able to individually power on to power your home and keep the battery charged. Another one of the advantages of micro inverters vs string inverters. Or installing multiple smaller string inverters instead of just 1 big inverter for the whole roof, that way you could have half of your panels providing power through 1 smaller inverter, and the other half being the \"excess\" that can't go anywhere.\n\nhttps://amp.reddit.com/r/Powerwall/comments/f1enij/solar_not_charging_during_power_outage_is_this_a/", "answers": {"1.1_gate": "0"}}, {"comment_index": 991, "comment": "I worked for a company that had Sunrun as one option for going solar.
