Republicans are still brain washed that EVs are bad. Some examples are, EVs pollute more because the power grid is coal powered. EVs will kill you in an accident because they start on fire and the fires are more violent. After a major disaster you'll be stuck there with no where to go. How will our powergrid handle all the extra EVs.

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Yeah. Because it’s not just about you, that one calf, and your personal moral success. If you repel three potential vegans for every calf you save, is that a victory?</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 3</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">I wish vegans wouldn't say things like, &quot;I can appreciate you being honest about not having a problem with killing animals. As least you aren't trying to make excuses.&quot;</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 1</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">You can't say &quot;Tesla actually delivers&quot; and then excuse a product of theirs with no solid release date that was supposed to release 3 years ago which they began taking deposits for 6 years ago.</div></div>

Here in California Net Metering (billing) rules are constantly changing.  And starting 2021 the rules are headed in a direction that basically harms new residential solar installs pretty badly.  If you’re in California and on the fence on solar, you need to get a system installed ASAP or else the economics and logic around solar get even worse next year.
The utilities here have long argued that Solar kills their profits.  Also, since Solar is primarily purc...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">The 8k isn't covered, it's added into the price you are paying.  That solar is only worth $18,000, if you bought it you would have gotten a $6400 tax credit from Fed and MA, meaning it's only $12,600 for the solar, but your 25 years of payments with SunRun are over $50k.  You are paying for that roof, they just told you it was free.  Like giving you a free Kia Soul for a candy bar, but I charged you $100k for the candy bar.... You could have just bought the candy bar and the car and been cheaper...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 3</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Yeah the people putting on solar today have a more reasonable agreement. But here in NY if you got in during straight net metering, you are locked to it for 20 years. These people love to brag how they just pay $20/mo connection fee and don’t pay a dime more. They are raising the rates for everyone else. 
The utilities do screw everyone when left to their own devices though. Straight ‘avoided cost’ is not the right answer either. It lies somewhere in between.

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Nah, this is vegan. If you look at the spice blend used in this recipe, the website for the spice blend suggests using it in a meat recipe. The spice blend itself doesn't have meat in it.</div></div>

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 1</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Yes, but the challenge of organizing a decertifying election is big enough it might give people reason to vote against a union in the first place. For example, do you prefer to re-elect (or vote for the other guy) for Congress every 2 years or would it be &quot;easier&quot; to never have an election until a majority of registered voters organized an election to try to elect a new representative?
Ultimately, this discussion is not about the pros or cons of unions. It's about a (silly) tax credit policy and...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">I’m sorry, ever post like this just gives my gas loving friends more evidence that EVs will never work. “This car won’t get any faster charge because the state of charge my car is at.” What has he proven?</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 3</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Right, but I was mainly making an example that the ID.3 is supposed to be a mainstream, high seller, like the ID.4, and unlike the ID.7.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 1</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Maybe I should rephrase the job title to better suit what I’m wondering about. ‘Solar advisor’ aka the person who helps size, layout, find funding sources, explain contract terms, explain net metering, answer the phone at 8am and 9pm and on weekends, and give excellent and accurate advice. 
It seems a good amount of people think sales person = liar despite the liars being the exception rather than the rule. 
I just wanted to know a number on what a ‘good’ sales person should make.</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Do you and the other family share the same meter?  If so, then crediting becomes easy.  If you have different meters, you would have to arrange &quot;virtual net metering&quot; with your power company, or else you would only get the wholesale rate for your over-generation (at least in MD, not sure if this is the case in MA).</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 3</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">The problem is the truck needs the power quickly and the solar array can’t necessarily deliver that, so whilst your panels may generate enough in the net to offset the trucks you’re still pulling from the grid.  An industrial battery must be used to work around this.</div></div>

Default choice for take-out or restaurants was whatever the meatiest option was. I also hunted and fished for food in the past. I genuinely considered it to be part of my culture.

The batteries were engineered with a lot more thought and better maintained. The Volt has a liquid cooling and sometimes heating system like most BEVs where the C-max has an air cooling system like the Leaf which can lead to faster degradation. With having a better range even with the battery buffer on the Volt, if your C-max degrades you’re going to immediately feel if with the tiny battery it’s equipped with. I wouldn’t look at air cooled batteries as a first choice nowadays with h...</div></div>

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">An F-150 lightning + 10 kW solar array would be enough to essentially guarantee energy independence and significantly reduce grid reliance. I hope other cars start to include V2H and V2G technology because even a 60 kWh battery could run your home for a few days.</div></div>

So, what I ended up doing is talking to another friend about how I was feeling and we agreed to take a car into a nearby city to get some other groceries (initially people didn’t want to do another grocery run; yesterday, a group in a separate car picked up groceries for the group and I hadn’t figured out a backup at that point).

<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">TRANSPORT · 3</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">Disagree here.  In my experience the current non-SC network is a mess of disjoined 3rd party units that are usually small stations, unreliable, slow and/or frequently in inconvenient locations.  Without the system being pressure tested by a large number of users, which Tesla vastly out numbers non, there really isn't any comparison.  The well thought out locations, ease of use, and shear number of chargers far out paces the conglomerate of 3rd party options.

That's the angle that the sun is at on the June solstice at the North Pole.  It stays light all day at the North Pole during the summer solstice, and that melts a lot of ice because the sun is at a high enough angle to be warm. 
The atmosphere has nothing to do with the angle of the sun. It is pulled to the equator by the centrifugal motion of the earth's rotation. 
Solar panels generate less electricity the farther from the equator because the angle of the s...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment" style="border-left: 4px solid #8fcc8f;">When I say that metering, I just mean one to one. In Illinois metering is either one to one, or you're on avoided cost / net billing. In best case scenarios this equates to a 30% to one, in worst case it's closer to 17% to one. And the bill credits reset monthly.
Also the more important point to remember with Illinois net metering is the bill credits stack monthly with a single point in the year where they reset typically in April.

One is disconnected. 4 solar panels are connected to each other. These four are then in sets of two panels in series with each other - the two pairs  of two are connected in parallel.  
previously all five were in paralel. The system tripped more at that point - although I also re-crimped all my connections while doing it, so maybe that helped too.

We have solar panels as well. In fact many cars are right now unable to travel due to no gas and the stations don't have electricity to pump the gas. We are able to run our car in the garage and get some A/C to cool down. So in my view the EVs are better than ICE cars. 
We have power in the house due to the Power Wall. Very quiet and A/C everything runs. We are in a far better place than others with ICE cars.</div></div>

Also in bay area with 2 day old Tesla install.  8.5kW and Powerwall+.  Fully functioning and waiting on inspection and PTO.  Yesterday was the first full day and produced 32kWh, but it was fairly cloudy.  Also, the panels shut off when the battery is 100% charged and I wasn't drawing much power during the middle of the day and excess power wasn't being sent to the grid.  So I can't wait to see what a full day looks like.</div></div>

Tofu, peppers, onions, mushrooms and spinach. I put turmeric and Trader Joe’s taco seasoning in the tofu.  Cook all the veggies. I press the tofu, crumble with a fork, add spices then add it all to the veggies and throw in the spinach. 
I have them with wraps. I like the Trader Joe’s jalapeños and like wrap. You can prewrap them and then just heat in the morning.  Lately I’ve been having it with some plant protein wrap I found which has half the calories as I’m...</div></div>

Usually this comparison is dangerous because  it provides an easy reason for a non-vegan to act all haughty and shut down the discussion, but you're right, if any consideration at all is given to animal suffering, then by comparison, factory farms are probably responsible for at least a comparable amount of suffering</div></div>

With that out of the way, the case of not life-saving research (like the one in your example) is of course very different. Some problems that would bother me even when while the experiment is running all conditions are perfect (similar to the con...</div></div>

The Ioniq is a great commuter car since it is incredibly efficient but struggles long distance due to battery size and slow charging speeds.

It's biggest advantage is how fun they are to drive, and biggest disadvantage is the battery degradation relative to other EV's. It's relative cost to value compared with similarly equipped EVs isn't helping, and Nissan's famous post warranty repair service drives the final nail into any repeat business.

The batteries were engineered with a lot more thought and better maintained. The Volt has a liquid cooling and sometimes heating system like most BEVs where the C-max has an air cooling system like the Leaf which can lead to faster degradation. With having a better range even with the battery buffer on the Volt, if your C-max degrades you’re going to immediately feel if with the tiny battery it’s equipped with. I wouldn’t look at air cooled batteries as a first choice nowadays with h...</div></div>

Some companies will also offer to trim branches as well to help your panel’s efficiency. I’ve had to do it for a few customers. Usually costs around $500-$1,500 depending on how many trees need to be trimmed, how many branches, size of tree, location of branches, etc etc etc.

You still need a permit, inspections and interconnect 
and your system will perform dramatically less than a net metering configuration because it will have no place to put the extra power generated so it will just not be generated.  
Most grid tie inverters can be configured this way for locations that do not have net metering.  If you have net metering then, I highly suggest that you use it.

No one is imposing their beliefs on her daughter's boyfriend. They're not asking him to go vegan. They're offering him a free meal, and he's refusing because he doesn't like the free food that's offered. That's extremely entitled behavior for a 16 year old.
&gt;Being vegan is great
Pretty obvious you don't ...</div></div>

There is no problem with being a vegan, if one of my girlfriends vegan friends come over for dinner I’ll make something vegan for her. Does she force her veganism on me and criticize me for making meat for the rest of us? No because that shit is so fucking stupid. It does not register in my brain why you think you have the right to harass other people for eating meat and think that you are better than everyone else ...</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">FOOD · 3</div><div class="example-comment">&quot;The fake meats are also more expensive so if you buy it you give twice as much money to the carnist which means he doubles up on steak killing 10x more animals all due to veganism&quot;

Come to think of it, I expect the majority of Supercharger usage falls into this category - people just don't take long trips where Supercharging is really needed that often. Tesla hasn't done much wrong, but making the Superchargers completely free was probably one thi...</div></div>

It sucks.
Legislators should mandate that all chargers must offer direct payment via credit/debit-card or phone. No car brand specific pricing, no app, no subscription, same price per kWh for everyone.</div></div>

I'm quoted $36k for 6.075 kW (7677 kWh) before incentives. A local source just quoted me $25k before incentives for the exact same wattage, which is 30% cheaper. It makes me feel like SunPower is exploiting the 30% tax credit. Am I wrong?</div></div>
<div class="sector-column"><div class="sector-header">HOUSING · 2</div><div class="example-comment">In general, solar leases give you marginal savings over the long term. If you want to take advantage of solar for cost savings, most of it comes from the tax credits and free energy after the system has paid for itself. In a solar lease, you're letting the solar company take 90% of this for themselves, leaving you with 10% of the benefit in the form of a slightly reduced power bill.
In the short term, a solar lease would be a huge hassle and negative when trying to sell your house because you ei...</div></div>

Talked to our rep, C, who lost his job an hour ago. Since we paid a \~$1000 down payment via ACH transfer and not credit card it looks like we are out that money.
Apparently SunPower was super behind on paying bills. Looks like SunPower stock is down 75% in the last few days.</div></div>

Some companies will also offer to trim branches as well to help your panel’s efficiency. I’ve had to do it for a few customers. Usually costs around $500-$1,500 depending on how many trees need to be trimmed, how many branches, size of tree, location of branches, etc etc etc. 
Also free solar is a scam, it’s usually called “free” but it’s a leasing program. 
Leasing solar panels is terrible and can hurt the v...</div></div>
