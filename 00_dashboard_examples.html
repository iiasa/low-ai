I’m all for solar power, but I’m not sure this is a good idea. Solar panels on roads are a gimmick at best, we’re talking solar panels that are suppose to withstand a metric ton of vehicle weight and efficiently collect sunlight…

My local Whole Foods ONLY has vegan donuts from a local vegan bakery. I've been with multiple omni friends who have turned a lip to them, and over heard other shoppers: &quot;are they even good?&quot;. They also stopped labeling all of them vegan (I know they are because I know the bakery), hopefully that isn't to try to increase sales by giving the illusion they are not vegan.</div></div>

EVEN IF THEY DID, you are killing less of them by begin a vegetarian (even less if you are vegan) because it takes more plants to feed an animal that you plan on eating (or using) than it does to feed a human.
