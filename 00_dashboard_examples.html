Your Child Tax Credit was recently doubled.  If the purpose of the credit was to encourage procreation, then it wouldn't be sunsetting back to half as much in 2011.  It also wouldn't be tied to income.  Having children is of course an argument for the child tax credit, but it really exists as another way to buy the loyalty of poorer families, a trend begun in modern times by Germany's innovation of the welfare state in the 1870s.</div></div>
