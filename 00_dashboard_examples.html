<div class="choices-label">Prompt uses only the comment's sector topic (not all three):</div>
<div class="prompt-text"><strong>transport:</strong> EVs</div>
<div class="prompt-text"><strong>food:</strong> veganism or vegetarianism / diet</div>

<div class="choices-label">Prompt template:</div>
<div class="prompt-text">What is the author's stance toward {sector_topic}?

DECISION TREE:
STEP 1: Is the author generally IN FAVOR or OPPOSED to {sector_topic}?

If IN FAVOR:
- Does the author complain about lack of {sector_topic} options/availability?
  YES: 'I want more {sector_topic} options' = pro but lack of options
  NO: 'I love {sector_topic}' = pro

If OPPOSED:
- Does the author support the concept but oppose a specific instance?
  YES: 'I like {sector_topic} but hate X brand' = against particular but pro
  NO: '{sector_topic} is stupid' = against

If UNCLEAR/AMBIGUOUS or BALANCED: neither/mixed

EXAMPLES:
PRO: 'I love {sector_topic}', 'vegan food gifts', positive framing about {sector_topic}
PRO BUT LACK OF OPTIONS: 'I want more {sector_topic} options', 'wish there were more {sector_topic} choices', complains about insufficient {sector_topic} availability while supporting concept
AGAINST: '{sector_topic} is stupid', opposes {sector_topic} policies, 'people with {sector_topic} think they're above everyone'
AGAINST PARTICULAR BUT PRO: 'I like {sector_topic} but hate X', 'concept is great but this implementation sucks'
NEITHER/MIXED: just titles without stance, neutral comparisons, truly balanced or ambiguous

KEY: Don't default to 'neither/mixed' when there are clear pro/against indicators.

Answer with exactly one of: against, against particular but pro, neither/mixed, pro, pro but lack of options.</div>

If Tesla can code an app to communicate with Tesla’s server and enable payment, they can certainly also code a payment stall to do that job.
I don’t know why so many see this as an obstacle. It is a pretty minor task.
For comparison: Tesla retrofitted an additional CCS cable on their stalls. It took them 3 months to cover most of their supercharger stations in Europe. That was actually a physical modification ...</div></div>

EVs are all DC, they don't need an inverter to charge. (And even if they did, they come bundled with them anyways)

<div class="prompt-text">A social norm is a SHARED EXPECTATION about what is typical or approved in a SOCIAL GROUP.

CODE AS 'yes' only when the text expresses:
1. Descriptive norm (what people TYPICALLY DO): 'Most people here drive EVs', 'Everyone in my neighborhood has solar', '80% of people...', 'The vegan community does X'
2. Injunctive norm (what people SHOULD DO or approve/disapprove): 'You should go vegan', 'Eating meat is wrong', 'People approve of EVs'

CODE AS 'no' when the text contains:
- Company/corporate actions: 'Tesla will invest...' (NOT a social norm)
- Technical facts: 'This EV gets 40 miles per charge' (NOT a social norm)
- Personal opinions: 'I think EVs are great' (personal, not shared expectation)
- Personal actions alone: 'I bought a vegan cookbook' (individual, not norm)
- Questions without norm content: 'What about buying a Rivian?' (NOT a social norm)
- News headlines: 'Potentia Solar to Develop 30MW' (NOT a social norm)
- Product comparisons: 'e-bike with beefy battery' (NOT a social norm)

KEY TEST: Does the text reference a SHARED belief/expectation among a SOCIAL GROUP (people, community, friends, family)? If it's just about companies, products, facts, or individual actions, code as 'no'. If it's about what a social group typically does or approves, code as 'yes'.

- No possessive: 'a friend' (not 'my friend'), 'people', 'someone'
- Hypothetical: 'if you were...', 'you could...'
- General you: 'Next time, try...' (advice, not reference group)

EXAMPLES:
FAMILY: 'My family all drive Teslas'
FRIENDS: 'My friends mock vegetarians'
OTHER: 'many people really don't think that far' (generic people, no personal connection)
OTHER: 'Trina or Suneva' (companies, not social group)
OTHER: 'ask people questions' (hypothetical people, no personal connection)
OTHER: 'Next time, try...' (general advice, not a reference group)

Remember: If there's NO possessive (my/our/their) and it's just generic 'people', code as 'other'.

CODE AS 'pro' when the reference group:
- Supports or is in favor: 'My family all drive EVs'
- Does the behavior: 'My neighbor has solar panels'
- Positive framing: 'up-to-date battery plants', 'revolution is here'
- Hopeful/optimistic: 'Affordable EVs...we'll see'
- Jumped in/adopted: 'I just jumped right in'

CODE AS 'against' when the reference group:
- Opposes or rejects: 'My coworkers think EVs are a waste'
- Critical/dismissive: 'she'll pull the experience card'
- Expresses concern: 'price cut is concerning'
- Sarcastic/skeptical: 'according to BRITISH Petroleum' (sarcasm)
- Technical objections: 'will expand complexity/cost'

CODE AS 'neither/mixed' when:
- Truly ambiguous or unclear stance
- Mixed views explicitly stated: 'Some friends like it, others don't'
- Neutral technical discussion without stance indicators

INFERRING STANCE:
- Positive framing ('revolutionary', 'up-to-date') suggests pro
- Negative framing ('concerning', 'complexity') suggests against
- Hopeful language ('we'll see', 'coming soon') suggests pro
- Sarcasm about opponents suggests against opponents (= pro topic)
- Behavior adoption ('has solar', 'drives EV') suggests pro

If the stance is not explicit, infer from tone, framing, and behavior.

So that's the one that should have the longest run, because if the wires sizes are equal, it'll have the least amount of voltage drop.

That’s why I’ve switched my stance to a more pragmatic one of supporting sustainable meat.</div></div>

<div class="prompt-box">
<div class="prompt-text">Injunctive norms are social rules about what behaviors are APPROVED or DISAPPROVED.

CODE AS 'present' when the text contains:
1. MODAL VERBS (prescriptive): should, must, ought to, have to, need to - 'You should go vegan', 'Everyone needs to switch to electric'
2. IMPERATIVES (commands): Do this, don't do that, get X - 'Do it Yourself Solar Panels', 'tell her to be on the lookout'
3. EXPLICIT ADVICE/ENCOURAGEMENT: 'My advice is...', 'I recommend...', 'try this' - 'My advice is if you want a vegan animal get...'
4. RULES/PROHIBITIONS: forbid, ban, not allowed, must not - 'forbid certain food from their kids'
5. APPROVAL/DISAPPROVAL (prescriptive): 'Eating meat is wrong', 'EVs are the right choice'

CODE AS 'absent' when:
- Self-report only: 'I am a vegetarian' (describing own behavior, not telling others)
- Descriptive only: 'Most people go vegan' (what people do, not should do)
- Personal opinion: 'I think EVs are good' (personal view, not prescribing)
- Factual discussion: 'There are limits' (just facts, no prescription)
- Technical analysis: 'doesn't account for battery storage' (analysis, not rule)

CODE AS 'unclear' only when there might be an implied prescriptive element but it's genuinely ambiguous. Do NOT use 'unclear' as a default when you see no clear injunctive language.

KEY INDICATORS:
- Modal verbs (should/must/need to) → present
- Imperatives (do this, get that) → present
- Advice/recommendations → present
- Just describing behavior → absent
- Just stating facts/opinions → absent

Answer with exactly one of: present, absent, unclear.</div>

If you're not into cooking, a vegan Mediterranean-style mezze platter is one of the easiest ways to make a really impressive looking meal that's also very flexible for different situations (it can be very cheap or very expensive, a little food or a lot), and much easier to do than it looks.

As far as sacrificing animals, that is widely accepted as not necessary anymore, after the death of Jesus, so it is neither here nor there.

During the weekends it's lots of hit and run trips for groceries, coffee, kids activities...  Level 1 is more then enough to get back to 100% in a reasonable amount of time.  Maybe once the ranges start going up Level 2 may become more useful.

You would be hard pressed to find a Solar Panel Company using Coal when it is just in the experimental stages.
There is a pilot project to try to derive carbon fibre from Coal using renewables and not burning the Coal. This could possibly work but they just got funding.

On the &quot;human health&quot; issue, I agree that the pollution from burning coal contributes to health issues, but I don't think it's accurate to say that the pollution directly kills hundreds of thousands of people a year.  It's a cumulative thi...</div></div>

&amp;gt;We are a proponent of kWh pricing because it is usage-based and EV drivers pay fees based on the actual amount of power consumed during the charging session rather than the amount of time that the car is plugged into the station. 
This is bad. As more and more EVs get on the road, there **needs** to be an incentive for people to leave charging stations when they are finished. If people are billed for an hour worth of charge, no matter if they occupy their space for...</div></div>

I tested many small portable solar systems and used the system everyday. After a month, everything has degraded with not much power output. Battery also ran out of power quicker.
