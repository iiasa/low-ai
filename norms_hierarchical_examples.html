<div class="example-comment" style="background-color: #7d3c9810; border-left-color: #7d3c98;">I work in the solar industry and I do not recommend SunPower. Their customer service is simply awful. If you need assistance in the future, that would complicate things. Plus, I feel like their system is not as modern as Enphase or SolarEdge. For residential solar, I def recommend Enphase! It's more expensive but their equipment is really good, same goes for their customer support. They have technicians in every state that can help troubleshoot too in case your solar installer goes out of business. We get a lot of customers who are desperate to get their system fixed because their installer is no longer active...  
In addition, the Enphase monitoring system is way more advanced, giving you a lot more data from the system. Anyways, lmk if you have questions!</div>

<div class="example-comment" style="background-color: #2980b910; border-left-color: #2980b9;">We are at a point where we have choice.  We can phase out fossil fuels rapidly,  end deforestation,  an stabilize the climate at a civilization-supporting temperature.   This doesn't mean that we'll succeed, but that with effort, we might in the next few decades.    [If we do, the climate will stabilize](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached). 
  
The fossil fuel industry playbook has shifted a bit in recent years, [changing from "there is no problem" as the main emphasis, to "it's too late to do anything"](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/michael-e-mann/the-new-climate-war/9781541758223/) as a means of preventing action.
  
Don't give in. Take action instead.  [Join](https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/b49xgi/how_to_get_involved_with_a_local_group_to_create/) a local group.  [Call your senators](https://call4climate.com/). Talk with people you know.  Post on whatever social media your friend group uses.
  
The big picture version of the plan for total social decarbonization is something like:

  * Decarbonize the electric supply
  * Electrify everything we can
  * Stop doing the things we can't

Think about what you have a propensity and capability for, and whether there's a way to fit in.  If you're somebody who could be an engineer, then work on heat pumps or decarbonized transportation or better designs for solar cells etc.  If you're somebody who could go into finance, think about what it would mean to work on making money available for carbon-neutral electric generation or storage, or for homeowners to be able to install heat pumps and insulation and rooftop solar panels.  If you could be doing marketing, think about how to reach out to people about those things.  If you're out to be a chemist, think about what you might need to know in order to support the significant industrial process changes needed to support manufacture of medicines and other useful materials without using petrochemicals as a feedstock.  If you'd rather be working with your hands, think about what it means to have the skills to build or maintain a wind turbine, or go into peoples' homes and replace their gas-burning heaters with an electric heat pumps.  Etc.</div>

<div class="example-comment" style="background-color: #2874a610; border-left-color: #2874a6;">Some people need to eat meat because their mental illness prevents them from being able to change to a plant based diet. I have a neighbor that can't manage daily needs, and has real allergies. Like certain foods cause anaphylactic shocks. He is bat shit crazy, elder services intervention level of daily living. So, he needs to eat meat in order to function. I can't white knight vegan his diet. I'm going for him staying not homeless, staying on the meds, and avoiding unintentional self injury. A vegan diet is way beyond impossible due to mental illness.

<div class="example-comment" style="background-color: #2874a610; border-left-color: #2874a6;">The Cybertruck was a mis-step.  Not because of it's design, but with other manufacturers competing with the 3 and Y, and some even coming in with lower priced options like the BoltEUV, leaving your most popular models stagnant while making a $100k pickup truck, especially one with a radical new design, is not what people were looking for.  Add in the problems they've had with virtually every aspect of this thing, and people get turned off.  Meanwhile their neighborhood car dealers are stocking more and more EVs all the time.  

Apple is successful with a very limited product line, but they continue to improve and innovate these products.  A 2020 MY is virtually indistinguishable from the 2024, except for a couple of color options, which replaced other similar colors.   That doesn't bother me, but people are already complaining about how they all look the same.</div>

You can drive all day and all night on superchargers and never contribute CO2.  (100% offset).

Renewables are the fastest growing segment of power generation. Uk, Germany, Netherlands... renewables are taking over. Scotland is 74% renewable. All the arguments you mention are fading fast.  Hawaii is going 100% renewables by 2045. 

The point is get an EV and buy renewables for guilt free driving!</div>

I'd never pay up for an EV given their current high expense and performance limitations. If I were in the market today, I'd check out the leases and do the math really carefully. That's something I didn't have to do with my EV, given that I paid $8,500 after the tax credit. It was the mother of all no-brainers.

As for solar panels, if I lived in the Southwest, and especially in SoCalEd's territory, I'd get 'em. Up here in Seattle, I laugh. Especially at my place, where the garage is the only unobstructed southern exposure and completely covering it in panels would replace 15% of my use. The EV gives me enough smugness credit around town, and it's actually fun and useful.

Back to the EV for a second, the reality with an EV is that, if you get one, you'll almost certainly wind up charging it at home even if you can find a free Level 3 Blink. Unless that free Blink is really close by, it'll be a matter of convenience.</div>

VW made a lot of missteps with software and interface, but the MEB platform is fundamentally sound.</div>

Need to build infrastructure to get them to the cities. Then you have to maintain them. So you are locked into greedy companies. 

Solar roof let's you be independent. Free electricity.

<div class="example-comment" style="background-color: #7d3c9810; border-left-color: #7d3c98;">I have a Tesla solar system that was installed in October 2022 and I have been extremely satisfied with it from the first day forward.

The sales and purchase process was extremely easy. Everything was done virtually until we got to a point where a personal visit was required.

I took pictures of my electrical panel and other relevant things, emailed them to a representative for evaluation, so they knew ahead of time exactly what I had. And they didn’t come out earlier because they didn’t need to.

They handled all the permitting with the City Hall, and everything was completely professional.

Installation day arrived and I could not have been more impressed. There were six men for the job arriving in two vehicles and they were waiting for about a half an hour for the truck carrying equipment to arrive. Once that happened, it was like poetry in motion.

Two trained and skilled electricians worked at my current panel and installed a new replacement panel. They also installed the battery pack and the inverter, and they connected everything together on the electrical side.

Meanwhile, four men were up on the roof with the solar panels installing everything. I purchased a 7.2 kW system with I believe 18 panels so it was not a small system at all, and it was installed on three different roof surfaces, yet they were finished by a little after noon.

The installers left, and the electricians remained to connect everything and get it all functioning and operational.  If memory serves me correctly, the electricians left at about 4:30 in the afternoon.

Everything was completed in one day from start to finish. I did have the permits already granted, and I did have all of the approvals that were necessary, but my house was completely untouched until the day that they arrived.

I couldn’t have been happier with the very professional way that everything was handled from beginning to end, but then I had to start using my system and find out how it was going to affect my life in the real world. 

I didn’t get my final permission to operate from  the local Edison company until December, so until actually the second half of the month of December I was unable to sell power back. I could generate power for my own needs during the day, and charge my Powerwall, but if there was any excess production after my battery was fully charged, it would not be used or would not benefit me in any way. 

Once permission to operate was granted, I was finally able to start selling back excess production.

As of my June bill, my total energy cost for the entire year was $44!

Don’t forget that my payment for the equipment is not included in that, but the main thing is that I am breaking almost exactly even with what I was paying directly to the Edison company prior to getting the solar equipment.  Of course at some point, I will own the system, and the loan payment will go away.

The $44 YTD reflects the massive savings that the solar equipment has provided me.

I really like the fact that I was dealing with one company and one product line. Other solar companies have to buy batteries from one manufacturer, panels from another, and inverters from a third, while a fourth company would be putting it all together into a cohesive system. 

I am what some people might call “living the dream”, since I also have an electric car. That $44 total energy consumption for the year from Edison also includes my “gasoline”, because of solar panels power my car as well.

I would have to give Tesla a 10 if such a rating were available to me. I simply have nothing negative to say about the entire experience. They called when they said they were going to call, they came out and did the job in an extremely professional manner, and it’s been functioning properly and exquisitely ever since, so I honestly don’t know what I could say in any sense negative about them.

I highly recommend Tesla to anyone considering solar. I did a lot of homework before I made the ultimate decision to go with them, and I am very glad I did.

I will be fair about my review and say that this is the only solar system that I have experience with. I don’t know if other companies do as good a job as Tesla did. Maybe they do. I simply don’t know that and can’t comment on it personally. but I will say that it seems less likely that other companies would be as successful simply because they are trying to integrate products from many different companies into a single system.

I want to make one other thing clear. I live in California and shortly after my system was installed the state changed the payback schedule for the solar power fed back into the grid.

The earlier schedule was known as NEM 2.0, or Net Energy Metering 2.0.  In April of this year they switched to what is referred to as NEM 3.0.

The new payback schedule is infinitely less favorable to the consumer and the solar panel owner who is trying to sell his power back to the grid.

To sum it up, I am very glad I chose to get solar installed, and I am very glad that I chose Tesla to do it for me.</div>

I also see it as a win and a tipping point to more non meat products. Isn't that what we are trying to do? Purity is selfish.</div>

The law says that anything to with "structure and decking" has no tax credit, but any other "preparation" like moving vents or adding more sealing material or replacing a damaged tile is fully tax crediting.</div>

Get yourself reusable bags or shop with an empty backpack, there's no point dwelling on the currently impossible when you can make easy, fast changes in your life.

Regarding the solar panels, I'm a big believer that to make big changes for the (near-)future experience of living beings, we first need to reach a point where we put ourselves first, this can be interpenetrated in many way.</div>

Solar without battery uses the grid and other customers as your battery source, increasing costs for non-solar customers.</div>
